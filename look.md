He stops moving forward and spins me around to face him, catching my other hand in his, before bringing his mouth to meet mine. My lips eagerly part beneath his, and as his tongue strokes over mine I press myself more firmly against him and he releases my hands, sliding his to my waist. Mine immediately wrap around him to pull him closer to me. His hands move down to my hips and then over my ass, before he lifts me up, and I wrap my legs around him. I can feel the heat coming off of him as I slip my tongue into his mouth, deepening our kiss. I manage to work my hands under his shirt when he gently pulls back, panting.

“This isn’t what you had on your mind when you asked me to walk with you,” he says.

“Well it’s damn sure what I have on my mind now,” I say kissing him again, my own breathing sounding equally as ragged.

He pulls back again though, and I’m forced to say, “This now. Talking later. Please, Liam. Please,” I repeat again, beseechingly, when he doesn’t move.

Finally his mouth is on mine again, as hungry for me as I am for him. His hand slips beneath my shirt to the small of my back, and I moan softly, bringing a new urgency to his movements. He sets me down so he can pull off my shirt, and I strip off his clothes exactly as quickly. His teeth find my nipple and gently nip at it. I wind one hand through his hair to keep me balanced and on my feet and wrap my other around his dick. He gasps as he brings his mouth back to mine. After a moment, I pull away and skim my lips over his jaw, before moving down his neck to his chest. I let my tongue trace over the ridges of his ribs, and the muscles of his stomach as I drop to my knees, and take the head of his penis into my mouth, moving my tongue over him languidly. The sound he makes as his hands tangle in my hair is enough to make me never want to stop, and I suck him deeper into my mouth, working my tongue along the length of him. I continue, as his breathing becomes rougher and rougher. In one quick motion, he pulls me from my knees, lifting me into the air and turning us around so my back is against the nearest tree, as he slides into me.

I find his mouth with my own to keep from shouting out in pleasure because there’s nothing shielding the sound right now, and we’re not that far from everyone else. But I definitely don’t have the ability to do anything about it right now. Liam is the only thing I can focus on as he thrusts into me again and again.

I’m nearly there when he drops a hand to trace across my clit as he continues to drive into me. It’s enough to push me over the edge, and I lock my legs around him holding him tight to me as I convulse around him, which is enough to pull him over with me.

He holds me against the tree for a few minutes as we both catch our breath and come down from the high. Eventually, he slowly lowers me to my feet, and I immediately miss his body pinning mine in place.

“Let’s stay here for a while,” I whisper.
