# Book 2

## Part 1

### 1 - Blue Monday ^^2500 words^^

It’s two days after the dinner party where I didn’t kill my mother. Two miserable days. It seems like everyone else is falling in line. My mother says, *‘Jump!’* and they’re quick to ask *‘How high?’*

It’s a new order.

Then there’s me. I feel like I’m being suffocated. Like I can’t breathe. I look around, and it seems like everyone else is fine. Even Alex seems *fine*. And I can’t understand it. How are they okay with this? How are they okay with letting Liam’s life be used as collateral for her own? With allowing her to force us all to take her back to Branton? With her decision to become involved in the Allied Polities politics?

As if there’s any surer way to start a war than to let her rule Avonare.

I’ve been spending a lot of time alone on the roof, thinking. Weighing my options. Considering things. Endeavoring to act instead of react, because Peter was right about that, as much as I hate to admit it.

Liam has tried more than once to convince me to come inside. Alex and Davy have both been up here to do the same. Gavin was up here a few hours ago.

Giorgi is here now.

Unlike the others, he’s been quiet. Hasn’t so much as said hello. Just nodded and sat down a few feet away about an hour ago.

The way I see it, she can kill Liam exactly once, and the second she does, she’s dead, and she knows it. Which means she can’t kill him at all. She thinks he’s leverage, and he is. Kind of. But he’s piss poor leverage. She’s not nearly so clever as she thinks she is.

I sigh. “What’s your take on all this?” I ask Giorgi, finally breaking my silence.

He leans back on his palms and shakes his blond hair out of his face. I can see him considering his words for a long moment before he finally says, “I don’t think she can see the future.”

“Fucking thank you!” I burst out with more than a hint of relief. I’m so glad to hear someone else say the same thing. “Why?” I ask him. I know all the reasons I don’t believe her, but I want to hear his.

He shrugs. “She’s too nervous. All the time.”

“What do you mean?”

“She’s nervous in the same way that you’re restless,” he elaborates after several moments. “It’s practically a character trait.”

“Huh. I never noticed.”

“Her left hand,” he states. “She has a habit of running her thumb across the pad of her middle finger. It’s small and you have to be looking for it, but it’s there.”

“You’re sure it’s nervousness?”

“Pretty sure.”

“Thanks. That helps.”

He nods.

----

It’s late afternoon when I finally go back inside, and the sun slants through the windows in a yellow so deep it borders on amber. I want to talk to Liam before I talk to anyone else, and he’ll be thrilled I’m not on the roof. I check the room we’ve been sharing—the room I refuse to refer to as mine—first, but he’s not there. I check the room Davy and Alex have been occupying next, but it’s empty as well.

I finally give in and do what I should have done days ago and feed magic back into the tracking spell I had abandoned. It falls back into place with an ease that makes me question whether or not I really *want* to do this. In for a penny though, and right now I’m in for a whole lot more than that.

I feel everyone outside somewhere, off to the southwest and I go looking. I’m not about to stay in this house alone for even a second.

I have to walk about a mile through the woods to get to them. It’s winter in Leisch, but we’re so close to the ocean that winters here are mild enough the forest is still tinged in green, just nowhere near the riot of growth it will be in the summer. Based on where it feels like they are, I wend my way down a small trail that’s barely bigger than a game trail. I don’t remember this being here last time I was in Leisch. But that was years ago.

The trail abruptly opens into a small clearing. Unfortunately, when it does, I realize they really are *all* in the woods. My mother included.

“Good. You’ve decided to join us, daughter,” she remarks with more than a hint of ice in her tone.

I manage to refrain from correcting her as I take up a position between Liam and Alex.

“I think Hazel has mentioned she prefers to be called by her name, Alexandria,” Peter tells her.

I find myself an odd mixture of surprised, confused, and grateful—surprised that anyone else bothered to say something, confused that it was Peter, and grateful that it was someone other than me, since she clearly doesn’t listen to or care what I have to say.

She says nothing in response, and only levels a cold, appraising look at Peter.

I watch her left hand, and notice Giorgi is right. She is ever so slightly rubbing the nail of her thumb across the tip of her middle finger. Interesting.

She continues staring Peter down, but he doesn’t look away. He just mildly matches her stare, but manages to do so without a hint of malice or irritation showing in his blue eyes. I wonder if I can learn to do that. Probably not.

“Hmm,” she finally says, before looking away first.

*What the hell just happened?* I wonder.

“Children,” she begins, and I hear Gavin smothering a laugh, which quickly spreads to the rest of us and suddenly, as we all stand there laughing, I feel better than I have in days. Weeks even. Probably since we left Branton.

A loud crack echoes through the clearing, and my mirth vanishes as quickly as it appeared. I look over and see a red handprint darkening Gavin’s left cheek. Before I can think better of it, I’m moving toward her. I grab her right shoulder and spin her toward me at the same time I shove, off balancing her enough so that she takes a step back, and trips over the foot I’ve planted in her path, sending her sprawling onto her back. I follow her down onto the ground, driving a knee into her stomach, and placing my forearm across her throat. I note that her eyes have widened in shock or fear. I’m not sure which, and don’t particularly care.

“You do not get to hurt my friends,” I tell her flatly, before slowly withdrawing my arm. “If you want to teach them, and they agree, fine.”

“I’ll do what I like, daughter. Or did you forget about Liam?”

“No, I didn’t forget about Liam. And no, you will *not* do what you like. You can kill Liam exactly once. Then you know what will happen. So you *will* stop with the idle threats toward Liam, and you will not hurt my friends. If you want allies,” I continue, “then you will treat us like allies. Do you understand?”

She says nothing, which I take as assent, and I return to my spot between Liam and Alex.

Alex throws an arm around my shoulders, which helps to mitigate the adrenaline coursing through my body a bit, but I still feel shaky. This is not how I planned on this going, and I’m not sure what the fallout is going to be.

I cast a sideways glance at Liam, hoping he’s not too upset by the fact that I basically just told my mother to try me when his life is what’s at stake. This is why I was hoping to talk to him alone first. I knew we would get to this point, and I knew it wouldn’t take long. I was just hoping it would take a little bit longer than this. But I’m done letting her be… her. It’s like I said, if she wants allies then we deserve to be treated as such.

It *is* a new fucking order. For everyone.

Thankfully, Liam looks unperturbed and reaches out to take my hand when he notices me glancing at him, which makes me feel a lot more secure in my decision not to let her run roughshod over us all.

My mother regains her feet, and continues on as if nothing happened. “Today you will all be learning magic.”

I sigh. I’d feel better if I had any idea what she was planning, but I guess there’s no time like the present to find out.

----

My mother concludes her class, if you can call it that, after a couple of hours and I think everyone is left frustrated by it. She spent a solid twenty minutes babbling on about esoteric energy meridians, then had them spend another twenty minutes visualizing the energy flowing along their meridians, *‘up and down, and up and down.’* I’m not kidding. She must have said ‘up and down’ at least two hundred times. Then she had them spend an hour and a half trying to push some rocks across the ground by projecting their energy meridians outward. It’s like she was trying to make everything as confusing as possible.

“Did any of that make sense to anyone?” Henry finally asks after my mother has left.

“No,” Giorgi answers and everyone else nods in agreement with him.

“Wanting something and letting yourself have it makes a lot more sense,” Gavin says.

Henry nods, agreeing with Gavin, but Lisette says, “None of it makes any sense!”

Of everyone, she’s the most frustrated. She was the one who asked if I could teach her and she still hasn’t figured out how to untie the knot. Gavin and Henry both have. I’m not sure if Giorgi’s even bothered trying.

“Fine,” I sigh. “Lisette. Come sit,” I tell her as I take a seat cross legged on the ground. “Liam, can you watch too?”

He nods and takes a seat next to me as Lisette sits across from me.

“Okay. Show me,” I tell her.

“Show you what? I can’t *do* anything!”

“Try to untie the knot. Even if nothing happens.”

I see a look of intense focus on her face, and I feel something, but it doesn’t exactly feel like she’s close. I look at Liam. “What do you think?”

“I don’t know,” he tells me. “I’ve only really paid attention to you, Alex, and Davy doing magic and I doubt that’s a valid comparison.”

“Gavin, can you untie the knot, please?”

He nods, and then does it with surprising quickness. Just a couple of seconds.

Once he’s done, I ask the same of Henry. Henry’s not as fast as Gavin, but he’s under the ten seconds I mentioned that first day.

“Try again, Lisette.”

She wears the same look of concentration mixed with frustration as she did earlier while trying to unknot the fabric strip.

“So,” I say to Liam again, “what do you think?”

“I feel something, but it’s not what it felt like when Henry and Gavin did it.”

I nod. “It felt the same to me.” I’m not really sure how to help. “Davy, any ideas?”

He shrugs. “She wanted to learn to make a fire. Try that.”

I’m not thrilled about it, but maybe it being the thing she wanted to learn will help. I have no idea.

“Fine. Tomorrow we’ll try fire,” I tell them all. “Until then, Lisette, keep trying the knot, and I don’t know. I guess the shit with the energy meridians or whatever. It sounds ridiculous to me, but who knows.

“Giorgi, are you getting in on this?” I ask.

He shrugs, but says, “Sure.”

“Can you do the knot?”

“I haven’t tried. I don’t care about unknotting some fabric, Hazel.”

I let out a long suffering sigh, but say, “Fine. Can you keep an eye on my mother? Earlier may have been a mistake.”

He nods and walks away back toward the house. Lisette, Gavin, and Henry trail after him.

“Hey, Peter,” I call out as he moves to leave too. “Thanks for earlier.”

A few minutes after Peter’s left, I can’t help but ask, “Should I not have done that?”

“It was bound to happen sooner or later,” Alex says. “May as well have been now.”

“You set a boundary,” Davy shrugs. “Who knows what she’ll do next, but that would be true regardless of whether or not you’d done anything today,” he reminds me, which is true.

I nod. “We need to get back to Branton. Sooner rather than later. The sooner we get back, the sooner we can figure out how to undo what she’s done to Liam.”

“I know. I’m working on it,” Davy tells me. “We can’t do another overland trip though. The pass we’ll be even worse. If we want to go in the next four months, we’re going to have to go by ship.”

“Fuck. Kill me now,” I groan. “That’s what? Six weeks at least?”

Davy nods. “Lucky we’re going southwest though. You can’t even sail the other direction this time of year.”

“We clearly have different definitions of ‘lucky’,” I tell him drily.

“What’s wrong with taking a ship?” Liam asks.

“I’m sorry, have you even *met* Hazel?” Alex questions him. “Is there any place more boring than a ship in the middle of the ocean? Even I’m going to be losing my mind after a couple of days.”

“By the end of the trip,” Davy tells Liam seriously, “you’re going to want to strangle both of them. They will be so desperately annoying you’ll want to spend at least a week avoiding them.”

I want to tell him to shut up, but I know he’s right. Right now, just the thought of having to be on a ship for that long is making my skin crawl and my mind bounce around frantically.

“I think I’d rather go back through the pass.”

“No,” Liam says with a look approaching horror on his face as he looks at me. “We’re not doing that again. Ever, I hope.”

“Okay,” I agree, because as bad as the pass was for me, I think it might have been worse for him. “I’m sorry I didn’t get the chance to talk to you first about calling her bluff. I was trying to find you so we could talk about it, but then, well. You know.”

He grins. “It was worth it. And who knows, maybe she’ll be less… Whatever she is.”

“I wouldn’t count on it.”

“Seconded,” Alex concurs.

“Let’s head back,” I tell the others. Dusk is quickly approaching the point of dark, and I can hear the faint hum of insects. “I need something to eat.”

“Are you done with the roof?” Liam asks.

“For now. Until the next time I feel like I’m suffocating,” I mutter. “How much longer until we can leave, Davy?”

“I’ll let you know tomorrow. I need to talk to the Vernes.”

“Do you think she’s actually friends with them?” I ask him, remembering what she said.

“No, but who knows. It turns out Alexandria is full of surprises,” Davy says.

“You’re not buying all the stuff about her being a seer, are you?”

“Eighty, twenty.”

“Care to elaborate?”

“I think there’s an eighty percent chance she’s full of shit, and a twenty percent chance she’s telling the truth.”

“Giorgi thinks she’s full of shit,” I tell them all. “He says she’s too nervous all the time.”

“Huh,” Davy says.

“Yeah. He said to watch her left hand,” I shrug. “Alex, what’s your take?”

“I don’t know. Maybe sixty, forty?” He sighs. “I honestly have no clue.”

### 2 - Chapter Name TBD ^^2000 words^^

Early the next morning, I have Lisette, Gavin, Giorgi, and Henry standing knee deep a broad shallow stream a few miles from the house. Fire’s not really any harder than anything else, but it’s a whole lot more dangerous and destructive than most things. Hence the stream. But it’s fucking cold this early in the morning.

“Well, if I wasn’t already awake, this would do it,” Gavin quips to Henry.

“I think my feet are going to go numb,” Lisette remarks.

“Think warm thoughts,” I tell her.

I distribute sheets of paper to everyone. Paper’s flammability point is low. It’s easy to burn. Easier than a stick. Or holding fire in your palm without anything for it consume as it burns. That actually takes most people some practice.

“So, now you all have paper. Next thing to do is set it on fire,” I say, setting my own piece of paper ablaze.

“Okay, but how?” Gavin asks.

“Same as anything. You want it to be on fire, and then you let yourself have it.” When I see the same confused looks as always, I continue, “Have you ever used sunlight refracted off a piece of glass to set something on fire?”

Everyone nods.

“Well. The glass doesn’t ask how, it just does it. You’re the sunlight and the glass. Congratulations. Let’s see what you’ve got. Try not to set yourselves on fire.”

“We could do that?” Henry asks.

“Who knows? Maybe. Shit can go really wrong, really fast with magic.”

“What’s the most wrong it’s gone for you?” Gavin questions.

“I almost died on the way here. *Before* we got to the pass,” I tell him as I exit the stream and return to dry ground. I don’t bother explaining that if Liam hadn’t killed the deer, I’m not sure I would have been fast enough. None of them know about the deer. I’d like to keep it that way.

“You almost died on the way here? Before the pass?” Peter asks softly from where he’s observing on the stream bank as I near him. He’s the only other one who came today. “Was that the day Liam came riding back with you on his horse?”

“Yes.”

“What happened?”

“The magic went really wrong. Really fast,” I answer, giving him a flat look that clearly says I don’t want to talk about it. He earned himself back some goodwill yesterday, but not that much.

“Does Liam know you almost died?”

“He was there, wasn’t he?”

“Doesn’t mean he knows,” Peter tells me, and he’s not wrong, generally speaking.

“He knows.”

“Hmm.”

I don’t want to ask, but it’s going to drive me nuts if I don’t, so I finally give in and say, “‘Hmm’ what?”

“I’m just surprised he wasn’t angrier, is all,” Peter comments, as he looks out at the others in the stream.

“He was plenty angry,” I tell Peter.

“Hmm. So, who do you think is going to get it first?”

“Giorgi.”

“Really? He hasn’t done anything at all yet. Not even the knot you gave the others.”

I shrug.

Ten minutes later, Giorgi’s paper is on fire. I look at Peter and raise my eyebrows. Then I wade back into the stream and give Giorgi two pieces of paper rolled into cones. “Figure out how to light them both at the same time,” I tell him and walk back to the shore.

“How did you know?” Peter asks me.

“Giorgi understands wanting something and letting yourself have it. He gets the idea of imposing your will on the world with the expectation that it will obey. You can look at him and practically see it,” I say softly. “He’s not… warm and fuzzy the way most people are. He’s a lot more like me than anyone else here is.”

Giorgi could torture a few thousand animals to death in pursuit of a goal if he needed to. Like me, I don’t think he’d enjoy it, but he could do it. I sigh.

Giorgi figures out how to do to two at once before anyone else figures out one. I roll ten more pieces of paper into cones and stick them in the sand spaced at intervals of about a foot.

“All ten. At the same time,” I say.

Giorgi nods, and I return to stand next to Peter.

“Do you think you could do that?” I ask him. I’m not really sure what Peter’s skills are like, beyond being good at fucking with people’s memories.

“Maybe,” he tells me. “Probably.”

I stick ten more rolled pieces of paper into the sand. “Do you think you can do it before Giorgi?” I ask in challenge.

He sighs, but turns his focus to the paper cones.

In a few minutes, Peter has all ten pieces of paper alight.

“Not bad,” I tell him. “A bit slow. You could definitely use some practice. But not bad.”

“Thanks for the most tepid compliment I’ve ever heard, Hazel,” Peter says sarcastically.

“Get faster and the compliments might get better,” I tell him without hesitation.

Another five minutes pass before Giorgi manages to get his paper cones lit. But he does, and all at the same time too.

“Nice,” I tell him. “Come out of the stream.” I wait for him to near Peter and me, and then tell him, “You’re actually pretty good at this. Good enough to fuck it up spectacularly, so do me a favor and don’t practice this shit alone, yeah?”

He nods in assent, then says quietly, “You know your mom’s been watching for the last twenty minutes?”

“Fuck,” I groan out. “You couldn’t have mentioned that twenty minutes ago?”

“I was a bit busy then,” he tells me with a shrug.

“Where is she?” I ask him.

“About sixty feet diagonally over your left shoulder.”

“And she’s just been watching?”

He nods.

“Okay. Thanks.”

Giorgi stands next to Peter and I as we watch the others. “Henry will be next,” I tell them both.

Sure enough, about ten minutes later, Henry manages to light his paper. I wade back in and hand him two paper cones, and give him the same instructions I gave Giorgi.

I sigh. “I’m probably going to regret this,” I mutter. Then I turn and pitch my voice loudly enough to carry. “Would you like to come join us?” I ask my mother. I want to sarcastically add on, *and offer your vast expertise,* but I restrain myself from being a total dick.

She takes a moment to think about it, I guess, and then walks over to us. She stands on the far side, keeping Giorgi and Peter between us.

“So. Any thoughts?” I ask when she’s quiet for several minutes.

“Wanting something and letting yourself have it might work for the others, but it’s not going to work for the blond,” she says finally.

“Lisette,” I remind her, because people do have names. “Okay.” I pause, but she doesn’t say anything else. “Then what do you think will?”

“What I was teaching them yesterday.”

“Seriously? You weren’t just screwing with them?”

“No, daughter, I was not ‘just screwing with them’,” she says in fair imitation of me.

“Hazel,” Peter and I both tell her at the same time.

“My name is Hazel. Her name is Lisette. This is Peter,” I say as I point to him. “And that’s Giorgi. Gavin is in the river. As is Henry. Henry is the one holding two pieces of paper. *We all have names.*”

She sighs. Loudly.

Moments later, Gavin successfully sets his paper aflame. I wade back in and give Gavin two pieces of paper, the same as the others. Lisette is still struggling though, and even I have to admit my mother is right. This isn’t working for her.

When I return to dry land, my mother continues, “*You* never had to learn about moving energy around because you’re able to innately do it, without thinking about it, without even realizing you’re doing it. She, clearly, cannot.”

“Fine, so go help her, then,” I say irritatedly.

She snorts in what might be amusement. “And wade into the creek? I think not. She, and the others, can show up to my class this afternoon. We can both teach them,” she says nodding as if the decision has been made and everyone has agreed to it.

I successfully fight to keep from rolling my eyes.

----

When I return to the house, I find Liam with Alex and Davy out on the grounds near the topiary bear. I think my mother maintains the topiary zoo herself. It’s weird. Everything about this place is weird.

“What are you guys up to?” I ask.

“Planning. That thing you’re terrible at,” Alex tells me.

“Planning…?”

“We’ll talk about it later.”

“Fine. Well. Giorgi.” I pause, trying to decide what to say.

“What about Giorgi?” Liam asks.

“We have a lot in common.”

“What do you mean?”

Again, I debate how to answer this. “He’s potentially really powerful. More so than any of the others. Not exactly… I don’t know. I’m guessing he doesn’t feel guilty about anything ever, either. And once he’s made a decision, the ends justify the means regardless of what the means are. Could be useful,” I say with a shrug.

“How’d it go with Lisette?” Davy asks.

“Same as before. Alexandria says that she needs to learn about energy meridians or whatever.”

“She was there this morning? *That* is interesting.”

“Yeah, according to Giorgi she showed up about twenty minutes into it. Stood watching in the distance for a while before I invited her over,” I tell Davy.

“*You* invited her over?” Alex asks, as if he thinks he misheard me.

“Yeah. Lisette,” I explain with a disgruntled sigh, “I don’t know what to do about her, and it’s possible that our mother may know more about teaching magic to people than I do, since I know absolutely nothing.”

“I wouldn’t count on it,” Davy says. “I think she might have just gotten lucky with the three of us.”

“Maybe. Did she ever mention energy meridians to either of you before yesterday?” I ask Davy and Alex.

“No,” they both answer.

“That’s what I thought. I said as much to her this morning when she said that Lisette needed to learn how to move energy around. She told me that she never had to teach me because I intrinsically knew how to do it, and Lisette doesn’t. I’m not sure if she’s full of shit or not.

“Anyway, she wants us both to teach them. She’s apparently holding her class this afternoon, back in the clearing. She has requested we all attend.”

“I won’t be able to make it,” Davy tells me quickly.

“What are you doing?”

“Talking to the Vernes. Getting us a ship.”

“I’m coming too,” I tell him. “I want to meet them. Alex, can you make sure she doesn’t kill everyone while we’re gone?”

“Sure, sure. I’ll babysit mom. I have more experience with it than you guys anyway. But you’ll owe me.”

“Owe you what?”

“I’ll let you know when I know.”

I sigh, but don’t object. “Where are you meeting the Vernes?

“Lusigan,” Davy answers.

Of course. Where else would you meet the ruling family of the polity except for the capital of the polity. Fucking politics.

“That’s what, thirty miles? Liam, you want to come? Might be useful to find out if whatever she did to you changes or weakens over distance. I’m guessing it won’t, but it’d be good to verify that. Plus, it’ll give us a chance to try to teach you how to feed energy into your horse.”

“Yes, I’ll come, but I don’t know if I can do that,” Liam says.

“Good. And likewise. That’s why we’re going to try to teach you.”

He nods.

### 3 - Heathens ^^2500 words^^

An hour and a half later, Liam, Davy and I are standing in the stables.

“I figure we’ll try this here, before we leave,” I tell Liam. “It’s similar to the rings, but instead of heat, it’s only energy. We’ll have you try it with Davy first since the way your magic interacts with mine seems… volatile.”

Davy sighs and holds up his hand. I know he’s not keen about being a guinea pig, but between the two of us, he’s the safer option.

“And I just… push the energy into Davy?”

“Think of it less as a push and more of drip or a trickle,” I answer.

“Can I see one of you guys do it first? I think that might help.”

I look at Davy and he shrugs. “Okay,” I say as I place my hand against Davy’s, and he starts trickling energy into me. I’ve never actually had anyone actually do this to me before, and it feels so weird. It’s like my hand is vibrating from the inside out. It doesn’t hurt, but the sensation isn’t exactly pleasant. Still, I stay there for a few seconds before pulling my hand back.

“Got it?” I ask Liam.

He nods, and puts his hand up to Davy’s. Almost immediately, Davy yanks his hand back with a hiss.

“Less,” Davy says, and extends his hand back to Liam’s. After a moment, he says, “That’s better.”

“So this energy,” I explain, “it’s coming from you. But you’re not going to want to use your own energy for a thirty mile horse ride. This is where pulling energy out of the heat in the air is useful. You’ve seen me do that before, yeah?”

“Yeah, but it doesn’t mean I can do it,” Liam says skeptically.

“Try.”

“Show me again,” Liam says. “I’ve never watched you do it with the intention of trying to replicate it.”

“Davy will show you. He’s probably better to use as an example anyway.”

After a few seconds I feel the air begin to cool, and then it stops, and stabilizes. It kind of feels like clouds rolling in front of the sun on a sunny day.

“Good?” Davy asks Liam.

Liam nods, and I say, “Okay, now take the energy out of the air and let it trickle into Davy. Slowly. Very slowly. Just like before.”

They each put their hands back up and the air cools a little bit more, but Davy doesn’t yank his hand away like he did the first time. After a few seconds they drop their hands.

“That’s… I’m supposed to do that for thirty miles?” Liam asks incredulously.

I shrug. “Do it for however long you think you can, and then I’ll pick it up after that. It gets easier the more you do it. Eventually you should be able to do it without thinking. Okay. Let’s go,” I say as I lead my horse out.

----

Liam lasts about eight miles—or a bit less than twenty minutes, since we’re moving pretty quickly—before I see the exhaustion start to creep in, and I take over managing his horse’s energy for him.

Within the next hour, we’re entering Lusigan. Davy immediately takes us to a large house near the center of the city, and we hand our horses off to the help that comes rushing from the house’s stables. Davy quickly approaches the door and knocks while Liam and I trail behind.

I have no idea whose house this is, though I’m guessing Liam knows.

The door is opened by a middle-aged woman. “Davy Iverson, to see Amelia Price,” he announces to her.

“Guess we’re not hiding anymore,” I mutter.

“At this point,” Davy says over his shoulder, “doesn’t seem like there’s much reason to. It’s all coming out, so we may as well use it to our advantage as much as we can.”

The entire concept makes me nauseous. Liam, noting my discomfort takes my hand in his and squeezes it slightly. I move a little bit closer to him, and try not to dread a future that hasn’t yet happened too much.

A few moments later, Amelia appears at the door and invites us inside.

“Glad to see you made it back okay,” I tell her as we walk in. I don’t really care. In all honesty, I’ve barely thought about her since well before we left the pass, but it seems like one of those things you’re supposed to say.

“Thank you,” she responds, equanimously.

I begin looking around as she leads us to some sort of sitting room, already growing bored. As we sit down, I see Amelia notice and smirk.

“What can I do for you, Davy?” she asks. “I know coming here wasn’t Hazel’s idea. She already looks ready to leave.”

“Whatever,” I grumble.

Liam chuckles.

“Shut up,” I say elbowing him lightly in the ribs.

Davy rolls his eyes. “We want you to get us a meeting with the polity’s leaders. We need to get back to Branton and we need a ship. Seeing as they’ve been harboring and helping Alexandria Raidane, they seem in a likely position to help.”

Amelia nods as if she expected this, and perhaps she did. I don’t know where else we’d get a ship, short of commandeering one.

“Okay. Let’s go,” she tells us.

“Now?” I ask.

“Unless you’ve got somewhere else to be?”

“Nope, just surprised we’re not waiting around forever.”

“It’s my uncle and grandparents. They’ll make time,” she says with certainty.

“Huh,” I say.

“What?”

“Nothing,” I answer quickly. “I just, uh… Never mind.”

“What? Say it.”

“Hazel and I don’t have family like that,” Davy tells her.

“Oh.”

----

Twenty minutes later, we’re sitting in a government building. And true to Amelia’s statement, less than fifteen minutes after our arrival, two men with a definite family resemblance are walking into the room. The older man appears to be in his late sixties or early seventies, and the younger looks to be in his late forties. They both share the same tall, thin body type, and I imagine at one point they both had the same hair color as well, though the older man’s is now solidly grey, while the younger’s is a darker auburn than Amelia’s but streaked through with grey.

Amelia stands as they enter, and Liam, Davy, and I join her.

She begins introductions. “This is my uncle, John Verne,” she tells us gesturing to the younger of the two men, “and my grandfather Robert,” she says indicating the older man. She pauses to allow us to introduce ourselves.

“Davy Iverson,” Davy says, extending a hand, which they both shake.

“Iverson?” Robert asks with a sharp look.

“Christine Iverson is my mother,” Davy supplies emotionlessly.

Their eyes turn to me. I suck it up and say, “Hazel Raidane,” as I extend my own hand.

“Yes. The family resemblance is quite dramatic,” Robert says, shaking my hand.

“Hazel saved my life while we were crossing the pass,” Amelia tells her family. “Twice.”

Their eyes are somewhat more appraising as they turn back to me. “Your mother is very powerful,” John comments as he takes my hand.

“Yes,” I say in agreement. My mother and John appear to be a similar age. I wonder how well they know one another.

Finally they shift their eyes to Liam.

“Liam Marten,” he tells them, extending his hand. “Captain of the Guard of the Branton War College.”

*Well, one of us clearly understands how this game is played*, I think as I side eye him.

“Yes, I believe Amelia has mentioned you,” John says, as he takes his hand.

Liam nods and we all sit back down.

“So why are you all here?” Robert asks without preamble.

“We need to return to Branton, sooner rather than later, and will need a ship to do so,” Davy responds equally to the point.

I find myself liking this conversation more and more by the second.

“And we would be inclined to provide you with a ship because…?” John asks

“Well,” I interject, “according to my mother, your family is good friends with mine, and it is imperative to her that she returns quickly.” I’m interested to see what his response will be.

I can practically feel Davy glaring at me, but he can shove it. One way or another we’ll leave with what we need, and if I can do some fact checking in the process, more’s the better.

“What my cousin means to say,” Davy begins, and now I’m the one glaring.

“Cousin?” John quickly asks.

“Indeed,” Davy says, but does not elaborate further. “Anyway, what she means to say is that it is rather urgent,” and we would greatly appreciate any assistance you could offer.”

That is definitely *not* what I mean to say, but I bite my tongue and don’t contradict him.

“It seems like Alexandria may have left some parts of the story out,” John murmurs and Robert inclines his head slightly.

“Yes, well, if it makes you feel any better, I only recently found out you were… on speaking terms with one another. I was not aware that any of the polities ruling families knew where she was, let alone were friends? Allies? Of hers. How would you describe it?” I ask leaning forward slightly.

Robert looks at me, and I swear he looks amused. “We have a mutual goal. A common enemy, if you will,” he responds. “We are allies, of a sort, I suppose.”

“Interesting,” I say softly. She was telling the truth. In a manner of speaking. “How long have you been ‘allies’?”

“Many years,” he says waving a hand blithely. “Your father,” he says, and whatever reaction he sees on my face seems to confirm his suspicion, since he nods before continuing, “tends to have that effect on people.”

“So I’ve heard,” I say in agreement, digging my nails into the palm of my hand to distract myself from how much I dislike this conversation.

“I had always wanted to meet you,” he tells me. We knew she had a daughter, but she would never allow any of us to meet you.”

“I bet.” I lean back on the couch. I got the information I came for. I’m no longer particularly interested in this conversation.

“Returning to the matter at hand,” Davy says, prodding the others back on track. “We do actually need a ship. We aren’t prepared to cross the pass twice in the same season.”

“Yes, I’m surprised you survived the once,” Robert says.

Suddenly I’m interested again.

“You wouldn’t know anything about the avalanches?” I say as I study his face.

“I know that they happened,” he answers, “but no more than that. Though I can make an educated guess.”

“Can’t we all,” I mutter.

“And it seems everyone’s survival was primarily thanks to you and Davy?” Robert asks me, evidently having taken a liking to me.

“So it would seem,” I answer in the same blithe tone he used earlier.

“Mmm,” he grunts before also leaning back in his chair.

Apparently we’ve both gotten what we wanted out of this conversation.

Davy sighs in irritation before trying again, “If we could discuss the use of a ship, that would be wonderful.”

“Yes,” John agrees, “It’s like herding cats. I know the feeling well,” he says as he flicks a glance toward his father. “We will loan you a ship. On the condition that you allow Amelia and her cousin, my son, Michael to travel with you.”

“Could be dangerous,” I tell them. “They both might die. Ships in the winter sea are notoriously dangerous under the best conditions,” I say hoping to discourage them. I don’t even really trust Amelia. The last thing I want is some cousin of hers that I haven’t even met joining us. What I want is to say no.

“Amelia needs to go back anyway,” Liam says. They’re the first words he’s spoken since the introductions.

“Yes,” John agrees.

“Why do you want Michael to come?” I ask. “Shouldn’t you keep him here? Safe?”

John sighs, and rubs a hand over his face. “Your mother told my parents decades ago that there would come a time where they wouldn’t be able to sit this out. It appears that she was, unfortunately, right.”

“In Firgasu, we repressed and discouraged the use of magic more stringently than in any other polity,” Robert says.

“I’m aware.”

There have been many deaths in Firgasu over the years. Some of whom may have deserved it, but many more that were probably like me. Just minding their own business until someone caught on to what they were. The hypocrisy of it is ridiculous.

“We hoped that by doing so, we could create a better, more fair society. And maybe if the ruling families of the other polities had acted similarly, or maybe if they were all like you and your mother, that would have worked. But they didn’t, and they’re not, and we’ve hamstrung ourselves.”

*Like me and* my *mother?* I want to ask, because it seems like we know very different people. But I don’t. It just goes to show they have absolutely no idea what they’re talking about. Davy should be proud of my restraint.

Instead I say, “What, exactly, are you asking for?”

“They need to be taught magic. Both of them. And there’s no one here qualified to do it.”

“Do you understand that you are asking for my mother to torture your grandchildren?” I ask to be clear.

Robert looks at Davy, and Davy nods. “Whatever you think you know about Alexandria and her methods, I can guarantee you are missing large chunks of information. Alexandria is as likely to kill your grandchildren as she is to send them back to you as functional magic users. She would not regret their loss should she kill them.”

“You survived,” Amelia notes.

I look her in the eyes hard. “I still regularly have nightmares about my childhood. The kind of nightmares where you wake up unable to breathe. The kind of nightmares you have to spend all day shaking off. I have panic attacks all the time.”

I see her swallow.

“It’s possible she decides to stab you to test out whether or not you can heal the damage fast enough. Or worse, she stabs your cousin to see if you’re good enough to keep him alive.”

My eyes dart to Davy, and he lifts his shirt, displaying a two inch scar near his right kidney.

“That’s what you’re asking for,” I tell Robert, John, and Amelia.

“And yet you survived,” Robert says, echoing Amelia’s earlier statement.

“Whatever. Fine. Send your children to the slaughter. I take no responsibility for them though,” I tell him.

He raises his eyebrows. “I wouldn’t expect you to.”

“Good.” I fall back onto the couch, having risen to my feet at some point.

I already made some stupid claim of responsibility to seven others, which I still don’t even fully understand.

Davy looks at Amelia. “You’re sure?”

“Yes.”

Davy and I both sigh loudly, in unison.

“Fine,” he also agrees.

### 4 - Outta Me, Onto You ^^2400 words^^

We arrive back in Leisch late in the evening, and the house appears dark.

“Let’s take a walk,” Liam says after we stable the horses. He takes my hand, pulling me away from the house, as Davy heads towards it.

“Where are we going?” I ask after a few minutes.

“Nowhere. We’re just walking. I know you don’t like being in that house.”

“How do you think today went?”

“Fine. Robert liked you. Somehow they both seem to like your mother,” he sounds as confused as I am.

“Yeah. Well, I’m sure she can probably be charming if she puts her mind to it. The better to lure you into her clutches, I guess. I don’t want another person coming with us,” I admit.

“I know.”

“What do you make of that, anyway?”

“They’re more scared of General Iverson than they are of your mother,” he says softly.

“I wish I knew if their assessment of my mother or him was more wrong. I have a feeling I’m going to have to meet the man,” I mutter. I really don’t want to. “You’ve met him. What do you think?”

“I think my assessment of him is wholly incorrect,” Liam admits with a sigh. “He’s always seemed like what you would expect given the known facts. Cold and arrogant, but not an existential threat. I haven’t spent that much time around him though.

“How are dealing with all of this?” he asks me.

“I should be the one asking you that,” I answer. “Davy drugs you, then knocks you out and ties you to a horse, then my mother abducts you, and uses you as leverage to control me… I’m sorry. It’s a lot.”

“We can talk about me later,” he says, pulling me to a stop, and turning me to face him. The shadows cast be the moonlight make his eyes appear infinitely dark. “How are you doing?” he asks again.

“I’ve been better,” I finally answer. “Being here… it feels like the walls are closing in on me. It’s not my favorite thing in the world. And tomorrow is going to suck.”

“Why?”

“Actions have consequences,” I tell him, with a sigh.

“What do you mean?”

“She wanted me at her training, and I chose to go to Lusigan instead. There will be hell to pay, I’m sure.”

“You are an adult, she doesn’t dictate where you go.”

I laugh, but there’s no amusement in it. “I’m not sure you’ve been paying attention.”

“I saw you take her to the ground yesterday, like it was nothing,” Liam tells me firmly.

“Yes, thereby demonstrating to her that actions have consequences. Tit for tat, Liam,” I say as I lean into him and wrap my arms around him.

“Amelia and Michael will arrive tomorrow, and then we’ll all be leaving to go back to Branton. We won’t be here much longer.”

I sigh. “Yeah, but it’s not really going to get better, is it? Six weeks aboard a ship, if we’re lucky. And then Branton. I can’t even think about Branton beyond possibly undoing whatever my mother did to you. Everything else is just… an impossible task. I can’t be who they all want me to be.”

“Who do you think they want you to be?”

“A deterrent. Failing that, a weapon. The one that makes General Iverson fall back in line. But what they’re asking is just for me to become another version of him. But one that bows to their desires. I won’t be a tool for anyone, and I don’t want to rule anything.”

“Being your own person has gotten you this far,” Liam says and I feel his shoulders rise and fall in a shrug. “I think you can manage the next bit on your terms as well.”

“We’ll find out, I guess.” I tip my head back so I can see him. “Okay. Your turn. How are you dealing with all of this?”

“Your family is…”

“Insane?” I supply.

“A lot. I was going to say a lot, but insane works too. I can only imagine how much restraint it takes for you, since I find myself wanting to strangle your mother more with each passing day,” he says flatly, and I can’t help but laugh.

“I think you hide it a lot better than I do,” I inform him.

“We all hide it better than you,” he tells me, before kissing me. When we break apart he says, “I’m okay though. Let’s go back.”

I sigh, but I know he’s right. “Will you come tomorrow morning? When I’m ‘teaching’ the others? I still want a second opinion on Lisette because I have no idea what I’m doing with any of this. I’m the last person that should be teaching anyone.”

“Yes. But for what it’s worth, I’m beginning to think no one knows how to teach this shit. I’m starting to think it’s either something you figure out, or you don’t.”

“Maybe,” I say.

“Maybe?” he questions.

I nod. “Maybe.”

“You think there’s another way,” he says with certainty.

“Maybe.”

“And you don’t want to talk about it?”

“Not really.”

“Okay.”

----

We’re back in the stream the next morning. Alex and Davy are the only ones who aren’t here. I think they’re probably informing Alexandria of yesterday’s happenings.

Gavin, Lisette, and Henry are still working on lighting the paper, but Henry and Gavin are further along than Lisette, working on lighting multiple pieces at the same time. Getting them started is easy because they’re all more or less doing the same thing as they were yesterday.

Based on how yesterday went, Giorgi’s working on something new. Peter has joined Giorgi in the river this morning. So apparently I’m teaching Peter now too. To say I have mixed feelings about that is an understatement, but here we are.

Liam is standing on the riverbank watching the first group. Really, I should have him practicing as well, but Lisette. Right now he’s probably more valuable watching her, because I’m pretty sure I know what’s going to happen afternoon, and I’d rather it didn’t. I sigh, and turn my attention to Peter and Giorgi.

“So. Fire without a fuel source,” I say as I lift my hand, palm up, and make a globe of fire about six inches in diameter appear above it. “That’s what you’re working on today. Try not to burn yourselves.”

“Where are you getting the energy for that?” Peter asks.

“From the air.”

“Okay.”

I walk back to the bank and leave them to it.

“Lisette?” I ask Liam as I come to stand next to him.

“The same.”

“Damn.”

Liam wraps an arm around my waist and we stand there watching them.

I lean into him for a minute and then say, “You should go practice with Peter and Giorgi.”

“I’d rather stay her with you.”

“I know,” I say as I shove him slightly toward the stream.

Liam grumbles as he removes his boots and rolls up his pants before wading in. Between the three of them, my money’s on Giorgi figuring it out first. I’m going to have to talk to him later. But if it has to be someone, and I think it does, Giorgi’s a better choice than most.

About twenty minutes go by before Gavin is able to light both of his papers at the same time. So far, he’s slower than Henry to figure things out for the first time, but faster at refining them after that.

I set him the same task with ten at the same time that I gave Giorgi yesterday. About ten minutes after that, I’m doing the same for Henry. I expect that will keep them both busy for the remainder of the session. So far, there’s no change with Lisette.

Another twenty minutes go by, but as expected, Giorgi’s got a globe of fire hovering above his palm. It’s only a few inches in diameter though.

“Put it out,” I tell him. “Now do it again. Work on getting it the right size.”

He nods.

Ten minutes later he’s got it.

“Good. Keep practicing that for now.”

Peter and Liam get it at almost the same time, about fifteen minutes later, and I see them exchange a grin.

I have all three of them continue to practice it for a bit longer, before deciding that’s enough for today.

As they leave the water I grab Lisette’s arm. “Before this afternoon,” I tell her, “I want you to think very hard about whether or not this is something you really want to be able to do.” I see the anger flash across her face, and continue, “You’ve made it this far without any magic. It’s not something you need. So just think about it. That’s all.” I let go of her arm, and she walks away without saying anything.

“Giorgi, hold up a minute,” I call out. He pauses up ahead. When I catch up, Gavin, Peter, and Liam are all waiting with him. “You guys go ahead,” I tell them. “We’ll catch up.”

I stand there waiting until they start moving and are well out of earshot. “It might be useful for you to keep coming to these, but I think it would be more useful for you to meet me in stables. Say around one?”

“Okay.”

“You know you’re not like the others?” I ask as we start walking back toward the house.

“I am, and I’m not.”

“Yeah. I know that feeling well.”

“I expect so,” he says.

We walk in silence until we catch up to Liam, Gavin, and Peter, who I have the impression were likely walking very slowly in hopes that we would.

“What was all about?” Gavin asks.

I shrug.

“You know Giorgi will tell me later, so you may as well just spill it,” Gavin says.

I look at Giorgi and he shrugs before saying, “If he asks. Yeah. Probably.”

“Fair. I told Giorgi he would benefit from meeting me in the stables later. He’ll probably learn faster without the rest of you slowing him down.”

“Ah,” Peter says.

“Shut the fuck up, Peter,” I say warningly.

“What?” Liam asks.

“Nothing,” I answer quickly.

“You tell him, or I will,” Peter says.

“Go ahead,” I say, calling what I hope is a bluff.

“Hazel wants to train Giorgi up in hopes that if she… what? Breaks bad one day, someone might have a chance at killing her,” Peter says.

Fuck.

Liam stops dead in his tracks. Fuck.

Gods damned Peter. I glare at him. “You and I will be having words later,” I tell him.

Giorgi looks between me and Liam. “So tomorrow, then?” he asks me.

I look at Liam and nod. “Tomorrow.”

Gavin, Giorgi, and Peter walk off. I close my eyes, take a deep breath, and brace myself.

“Anything to say?” Liam asks.

“Peter’s an asshole,” I state flatly.

“Peter?” Liam asks incredulously. “You think Peter’s the asshole here?”

Fuck.

“You’re unbelievable!” Liam shouts.

“It is a valid concern,” I state levelly.

“So instead of talking to me about it, you want to teach Giorgi how to kill you?” he’s still shouting.

“I didn’t bother talking to you about it because I knew this is how the conversation would go. And Giorgi’s the only viable option, because if it comes down to it, you won’t do it. Davy won’t do. Alex won’t do it. But Giorgi would. I don’t know if he’ll be able to, but he would if he could.”

“Un-fucking-believable, Hazel!” Liam says, but he’s still standing there.

He hasn’t walked away yet, so I start talking. “Everyone wants the impossible from me, and maybe the impossible is the straw that breaks the camel’s back. I already feel like I’m just pretending at being a person half the time. This, all of this, could be what makes it so that I don’t bother pretending at all, so excuse me for wanting a contingency plan!”

“This isn’t a contingency plan.”

“It’s the *only* contingency plan,” I say, stepping towards him, but he steps back in retreat. “Fine. You want to know how I feel? I feel defeated because every time I try to explain this part of myself to you, you act like I’m irrational. But I’m not. *This* is logical. It is a *rational* decision.”

“I asked you to talk to me last night!”

“I tried to!” I shout back. “And you told me to be my own person!”

“Because who you are is fine.”

“Who I am is fine, *for now!* Until you all push me too far and I can’t find my way back to being this person anymore!”

“Okay,” Liam says, taking a breath and running a hand through his hair to push it out of his face. He steps toward me, and unlike him, I hold my ground, so he takes another step. “Okay,” he repeats and wraps his arms around me.

I stay rigid within his embrace though. “I hear what you’re saying, *but* I don’t think it’s a good plan. And I still think you should have told me about it last night. You were already planning this last night, weren’t you?”

“Yes. I was planning it last night. And fine, you asked, and I probably should have mentioned it. But unless you have a better solution, I don’t want listen to you tell me it’s a bad plan.” Okay. I guess I’m still angry.

“As a matter of fact, I do have a better solution.”

“Well?” I prompt.

“Be realistic. If it were ever to get to the point where Giorgi needed to kill you, it’s not like he’s going to be able to do it unless you let him, which at that point you wouldn’t.”

“Yes. I am also aware of that, but I don’t see a better option.”

“Figure out what your mother did to me, and then do it to yourself,” he says, matter of factly.

Damn. It *is* a better solution. I finally relent and wrap my arms around him too.

“Fine. Your plan is better,” I admit. “But until then I still want to teach Giorgi.”

“Fine,” he murmurs.

### 5 - D’You Know What I Mean? ^^2100 words^^

A couple of hours later, we arrive back at the house. Liam sees Gavin and asks, “Do you know where Peter is?”

“Outside, by the lawn animals with Alex and Davy, I think. Why?” Gavin asks as Liam is already moving forward with his hand on the small of my back. “Oh, well. This looks fun. Count me in,” Gavin says.

I shoot him a look over my shoulder with my eyebrows raised in question, but he just grins. We go through the house, out the rear door, and across the lawn to the topiary zoo.

Once we’re within twenty feet of the trio, I see Alex grab Davy’s arm and step back, at the same time Liam drops his hand from my back and continues striding forward alone toward Peter. Peter hears us behind him and begins turning toward us. As he completes the turn, Liam slams a hook into his ribs, and then nails him with a cross to his face that I’m pretty sure just broke his nose. And he’s already moving, grabbing Peter’s left arm, and yanking it around to force Peter to the ground face first. Once Peter’s on the ground Liam puts a knee on his back pinning him there.

“Stay the fuck out of my relationship, Peter,” Liam tells him flatly. “Got it?”

“Yeah, got it,” Peter grunts in pain.

Liam releases his arm, and moves back to stand by me.

“I thought Peter *wasn’t* the asshole?” I say softly.

“No, he’s an asshole too,” Liam answers quickly.

Gavin laughs as Davy asks, “What the hell was that about?”

“Nothing Peter didn’t deserve,” Gavin informs him.

Peter regains his feet with a hand on his face, feeling his nose. “I think you broke it,” Peter mumbles, glaring at Liam.

“Not for the first time, as I remember,” Gavin comments.

“Huh,” I say, giving Liam a sideways glance. He shrugs.

“See,” Gavin says to me with a smirk. “I told you he was just some neighborhood troublemaker we knew.”

I can’t help but laugh.

“Want me to fix it?” Alex is asking Peter.

“No,” Liam tells Alex. “If he wants it fixed he can figure out how to do it himself.”

Alex looks between them, and sighs. He steps back and leaves Peter to figure it out on his own.

It’s at this moment Henry comes out of the house with Amelia, and some guy I assume is her cousin, whatever his name was, trailing behind. When they finally come within speaking distance of our group, Amelia says, “That’s a good look on you, Peter,” as she laughs. “Did you do that, Hazel?”

“No,” I say, and look pointedly at Liam.

“Liam? Really? Interesting,” she comments. “I think I might actually prefer this version of you, Liam.”

Liam sighs irritably, but he brought this on himself as far as I’m concerned. Not that I wasn’t going to do something similar. But he kind of stole my thunder. And now if *I* punch Peter in the face, it looks like we’re unfairly targeting him.

Amelia’s cousin looks incredibly confused.

Finally, Amelia says, “Everyone, this is Michael. Michael, that’s Hazel, Liam, and Gavin,” she says pointing at us each in turn. “The idiot with the bloody face is Peter. The taller guy back there is Alex, and the shorter one is Davy. Alex is Hazel’s brother and Davy is her cousin. There are a couple of others around somewhere. Gavin’s younger brother Giorgi, and Lisette, who’s hard to miss.”

We all chorus some variation of ‘hi.’

“Henry, you know which rooms they’ll be staying in?” Davy asks.

“Yeah, I’ll show them,” Henry replies. “Come on, guys.”

“Make sure they make it to this afternoon’s training,” Davy calls after him. “You and I are going to have it coming,” Davy says, turning to me.

“I know,” I tell him. “She’s going to make it good too.”

“Yeah.”

----

We’re all back in the same clearing as a couple of days ago, waiting for her to show up. Davy and I have distanced ourselves from the others. There’s no reason to draw her attention to anyone else. So we stand alone, waiting for the axe to fall, as the others talk among themselves.

She walks into the clearing about fifteen minutes after the rest of us showed up. “Oh good. Hazel and Davy, have decided to join us today.”

“Shit,” I mutter and Davy nods in agreement. She used both of our names. Without prompting. She’s looking forward to whatever this is.

“They will be giving us a demonstration today,” she continues. “As they have clearly intuited.”

We both stand silently, waiting to hear whatever it is she’s devised, while the others look on with varying degrees of apprehension. Alex looks like a piano wire wound so tightly he might break at any moment, and I can see the concern etched across Liam’s face. The forced neutrality I see on Giorgi’s face tells me he also knows enough to know this is about to get ugly.

“Hazel and Davy are going to show us how to move energy through another’s meridians.” She turns to look directly at us. “You have three minutes to figure out how you want to do it.”

“Fine,” I answer. Turning my back slightly from the others. Davy follows suit as I shield the air around us to stop our conversation from traveling. “I’m pretty sure this is going to fucking hurt,” I tell Davy.

“Yup.”

“You should pull it through me,” I tell him. “I think I”m going to have to do this to Lisette, so it’d be better if I had some idea how it feels, anyway.”

“If I pull it through you, I’m not sure I’ll be able to shunt it off quickly enough,” he tells me.

“What if I try to slow the flow?”

“It’ll probably make it hurt worse,” he says.

“I know. It’s fine. I’ll deal with it.”

“Okay.”

I start the process of separating my mind from my body as much as I can, because I have the feeling this is going to be really, really painful, and I’m just going to have to let it happen.

I drop the shield and turn back to my mother. “How long?”

“Until I say you’re done.”

Fuck. “Fine,” I say flatly. “Let’s go, Davy.” I hold my hand out, and he wraps his own around it.

“Ready?” he asks me.

I ensure there’s not too much power flowing through me and nod.

It’s the reverse of yesterday, and I’m just a passive participant as Davy moves energy though me, and my body pulls in more to replace what he’s moving out of me, into himself, and then pushing back into our surroundings. It’s almost a perfect loop, but it hurts. A lot. It feels like I imagine having boiling liquid pumped through my veins would feel, and I move my mind further away from my body.

I don’t know how long it’s been—it feels like forever, but I really don’t know—when I hear the screaming start. I’m not sure who’s screaming. But someone. Not me, I think. I can’t deal with it though because keeping the flow of power limited and the pain from overwhelming me is taking all of my focus.

*Davy*, I think I realize eventually. *It’s Davy screaming*, I’m not sure what’s gone wrong, but apparently something has. I’m trying to shut it down, but I can’t. It’s all flowing the wrong way.

I think I hear Alex and Liam shouting in the distance but I can’t make out the words. It’s all just angry sounds.

Then, with a jolt that feels like I’ve been kicked by a horse, I’m flat on my back and someone is grabbing me under my arms and pulling me upright. Giorgi, I realize. I look around for Davy, and see him still on the ground with Alex hovering over him. I’m not sure how bad it is yet.

And Liam is holding a knife to my mother’s throat. “I’ll kill you myself,” he tells her, “if you ever pull another stunt like that. Right now, you are alive at my sufferance. Do not try me, Alexandria, because I would consider your life well worth my own,” he says icily.

Once I’m on my feet and no longer swaying, Giorgi releases me.

“We’re done today,” I tell everyone, but mostly her. “And if there’s anything wrong with Davy, I’ll figure out how to make you pay. You know I will.”

“He’ll be fine,” she says airily, as if she doesn’t have a knife to her throat. “You’re all always so dramatic.”

Liam removes the knife and she turns and walks away at the most deliberately sedate pace I have ever seen in my life.

I turn to Alex, “How is he?”

“His pulse was thready,” Alex says, “but it’s evening out now.”

“What happened?” I ask.

“After the first hour and half, he started sweating,” Henry supplies.

“Hour and a half? How long has it been?”

“Almost two and a half hours,” Alex says softly.

“Fucking bitch,” I manage to bite out.

“Yeah, he needed a break, but she wouldn’t call time, and he wasn’t about to stop before then and make it worse,” Alex supplies.

I nod. “He chose the smart move.”

“*That* was smart?” Liam asks.

“Yes,” Alex and I both say simultaneously.

“All of our blood is still inside our bodies. It could have been worse,” I tell him. “Gods, I hate her,” I mutter.

“Come on,” Liam says to Alex. “I’ll help you get him to your room.”

Alex nods and they lift Davy together, moving ahead of the rest of us.

“You good?” Giorgi asks me.

“Yeah, I’m good,” I answer. “Amelia and the other one. Can you and Gavin explain the shit with the knot to them? Show them?”

He nods.

“Thanks,” I say as he moves to speak to Gavin.

“You look like shit,” Lisette tells me.

“Yeah. Well.” I shrug. “Still want to be able to do magic?” I ask her. “Because I think we’re going to have to do something like that with you.”

“Let me sleep on it,” she says with the first hint of trepidation I’ve seen from her.

“Good choice,” I say as she moves ahead and is replaced by Peter. “Fucking Peter,” I mutter once I’m sure he’ll be able to hear.

“That looked pretty rough,” he tells me.

“Felt worse.”

“I’m sorry about earlier. With Liam.”

“Only because it earned you a busted face,” I say with certainty.

“Maybe. But you can’t honestly think keeping something like that from Liam is a good idea.”

“You’re right, but it’s still none of your business. You were trying to start a fight between us. What I can’t figure out is why. It’s okay though. I’ll get there eventually.”

“Because I’m an asshole,” he supplies.

“You are, but I think there’s more to it than that. I think you’re playing both sides against the middle.”

“If I am, I certainly don’t seem to be very good at it,” he comments drily, as he continues to walk next to me.

“Indeed.”

----

I make it back to the room Liam and I are occupying by myself, and he shows up about ten minutes after.

“How’s Davy?” I ask.

“The same, but Alex thinks he’ll be okay by the morning.”

I nod. “And Alex?”

“Angry. He’ll be fine though.”

“Okay. About Peter…”

“Yes?” Liam asks cautiously.

“How certain are you that you can trust him, because I swear he gives me the distinct impression that he’s going to fuck us all over at any minute.”

“If you’d asked me a month ago, I would have told you I trusted him with my life,” Liam says, as he drags a hand across his face. “Now… I don’t know. I think I still trust him, but I’ll be damned if he isn’t making it difficult.”

“Okay,” I say. He believed me when I said something similar about Alex, so I do the same. “Tell me if that changes, please.”

“Yeah. I will.”

“Good. Are you okay?” I ask him.

“I was better before that stunt your mom pulled in the woods,” he says, enfolding me in his arms.

“I did tell you,” I remind him.

“I know. It’s just different watching it happen first hand.”

“Yeah.”

### 6 - I Want to be Sedated (( I feel free??? )) ^^3200 words^^

It’s two days later and we’re all riding to the port to board a ship and spend the next month and a half being bored out of our minds.

At least we’ll be heading back to Branton—where hopefully I’ll be able to get some answers—instead of hanging around that stupid house. And when we get back, Reese’s churro shop is going to be my first stop.

Liam told me a few days ago that he got the key for the flat from Reese. She told him it was his mother's. That may or may not be true, and I intend to find out. Either way, she knows a lot more than the rest of us. And I wouldn’t mind having some churros too. Two birds with one stone.

I wonder if she knew who I was the first time Liam brought me in. I wouldn’t have thought so, but if she was as good of friends with my mother as Peter claims, she may have taken one look at me and figured it out.

If all these people could just mind their own business none of us would be in this mess.

The ship’s cramped enough that everyone but me has to watch their heads. It’s especially bad for the tall ones though. Alex, Liam, Peter, Gavin, and Lisette are about to have a rough time.

When I open the door to our cabin, I’ve never been more glad I don’t need much sleep. We’ll both be lucky to fit in the bed together.

“Well, this is cozy,” I say. “And to be clear, by cozy, I mean claustrophobic.” I throw my pack on the bed and then tell Liam, “I’m going back above deck.”

----

I’ve been leaning over the rail watching the land fade to nothing for a while. All I can see in any direction right now is water.

I turn my back to the rail and watch the crew. They’re busy and it looks more interesting than anything else happening here. I make my way over to the pilot.

“What kind of ship is this?” I ask him.

“A four masted barquentine. Good for dealing with the tricky wind conditions this time of year.”

“How long does it take to learn to sail one of these?”

“If you’re just following someone else’s orders? And doing as your told? Not long. To give the orders? Ages. Why? You fancy a life at sea?”

“Considering it,” I say.

“You know anything about navigation?”

“A bit.”

“Takes more than a bit,” he tells me.

“I’m a quick study,” I respond.

A hand comes down on my shoulder. “Forgive my sister,” Alex says from behind me. “She’s easily bored. Like a small child.”

“Piss off,” I tell Alex. “I’m considering a career change.” Looking back at the pilot I ask, “How much trouble would I be in if I went up into the rigging?”

“A lot,” he answers, and he is not amused by my suggestion.

“Figures,” I say. “Well on the off chance you need someone who isn’t afraid of heights and can climb, I’m available for at least the duration of this trip.”

I let Alex drag me away. “What do you want?” I grumble.

“Nothing. I just wanted to stop you from pissing the crew off on the very first day.”

“Fine. What do you think about Peter?”

“In what context?”

“Think he’s trustworthy?” I haven’t had the chance to talk to Alex much lately.

He shrugs. “Probably.”

“Then why does it feel like he’s waiting for the opportunity to stick a knife in my back?”

Alex shrugs. “Dunno. Mom plans to continue her training while we’re at sea.”

“Great.”

“She wants us all in the galley in an hour.”

“Super.”

“You should come now though,” he tells me.

“Why?”

“Because if you were smart, you’d spend the next six weeks eating to make up for the fact that you still look half starved.”

“Fine. Whatever. Lead on.”

Alex wends his way below deck with me trailing along behind him. When we enter the galley, everyone else is already there. Peter, Gavin, Giorgi and Henry are all playing dice.

“Dice,” I scoff in derision as I walk past.

“What’s wrong with dice?” Henry asks.

“All chance and no skill. It’s boring.”

“Well, I brought cards too,” Gavin says, as he scoops up the dice. “We can play poker later. As I recall, Liam is one up on you.”

I roll my eyes, but say, “Maybe.” It’s not like there’s anything else to do. And this is why I hate ships. Sitting around and eating, and eating and sitting around. The crew won’t even let you climb up into the rigging, which is arguably the only place on a ship worth being.

“Strip poker!” Gavin calls out from behind.

“Sounds like a terrible idea,” I say over my shoulder. “Count me in.”

“Me too!” Alex tells him.

Liam is sitting at a table with Davy, Lisette, Amelia, and Amelia’s cousin Michael who I don’t think I’ve said more than ten words to so far.

I sit down next to Liam, who immediately wraps an arm around me. “Strip poker?” he murmurs into my ear.

“Yes. Are you going to play?”

“Maybe. Did you convince anyone to let you up in the rigging,” he asks a bit louder.

“How did you know?” I ask.

Liam laughs. “You said the room was claustrophobic and then practically ran up to the deck. What else would you possibly be doing?”

“I could have just been getting some air,” I say.

“But you weren’t, were you?”

“No. Have you seen how tall the mast is?” I ask wistfully.

“Why would you want to go up there?” Michael asks.

“Why *wouldn’t* you?” I answer. “Imagine being up there in a storm,” I let myself daydream about it for a minute. “It would be glorious.”

Liam sighs.

“Behind you,” Lisette says with a nod.

I turn to find Davy and Alex carrying a cake. Damnit.

(( maybe all of this gets deleted? Do I hate it? I don’t know. Let’s keep going and see where it takes us. But probably delete it ))

I close my eyes and sigh. Birthdays. I hate them. Mostly mine. But apparently this is mine.

“This is what you were planning? When I asked a couple of days ago?”

“Don’t sound so disappointed, sis,” Alex says. “It’s the first birthday we’ve all been together in *years*!”

“A streak we definitely should have continued,” I tell him. “Thank you for the cake,” I say, trying to be polite.

“It’s cinnamon flavored,” Alex informs me.

He looks so pleased that I say, “Thank you,” again and try to actually mean it. Once he and Davy set the cake down I stand and hug them both.

He bends down and whispers, “Also, I may have drugged mom and locked her in her room. Happy birthday!”

“Seriously?” I ask, completely stunned. “That’s… incredible. Okay. I might not completely hate this birthday.”

“See. Planning.”

I roll my eyes.

“And we have plenty of party favors.”

“So you’re basically going to force me to celebrate?” I ask.

“Yes,” Davy answers handing me a piece of cake and a shot of vodka. “That’s one. I’m counting.”

“Of?”

“Twenty eight. Obviously.”

“There’s no way,” I tell him.

“Not with an attitude like that,” he comments as he takes a shot. “Two an hour over the next fourteen hours? You’ll manage. Probably.”

“There are worse ways to die,” I say as I down the first shot and take a bite of cake.

It’s sometime after the fourth shot that Gavin convinces me to play dice with them, and I start flagrantly cheating. “All sixes, all the time!” I boast after the third such roll.

“We know you’re cheating,” Peter says.

“Then figure out how to stop me,” I say with a grin.

“Oh, are we playing this game?” Alex asks from the next table over, suddenly interested.

He typically cares as much about games of chance as I do, which is not at all. If there’s not some amount of skill, some level of *earned* bragging rights involved at the end, count us out. But cheating turns dice from a game of chance into a game of skill. Really, sometimes cheating *does* improve a game.

“You can’t beat me,” I tell him with a grin.

“We’ll see. Limitations?”

“None.”

“You’ll regret that.”

“Will I?” I ask, knowing it’s entirely possible.

“One twenty?”

“Sure.”

We’ve got five dice, with a high roll of all sixes having a maximum of thirty points. If you have more than a single one in a role, you score nothing for that roll. If you have more than three ones in a single roll, you lose all the points you’ve accumulated so far. First person to a hundred and twenty points wins. Simple.

I roll first. I can feel Alex trying to flip my dice, but I don’t let him. “Thirty points,” I say smugly.

He scowls at me, and picks up the dice. He cups his hands around them, shakes them, and lets them go. I manage to flip three of them to ones before they hit the table top.

“Oh, look at that. No points. How sad for you,” I snark.

I pick the dice up, and roll again. This time, as I release them, I feel something hit my chair, and it’s tipping backwards. I split my focus in an effort to avoid  bashing my head on the floor as my chair tips, and by the time my dice hit the table, three of them are ones.

“Oh, look at that. No points. How sad for you,” Alex says, mocking me.

“Playing dirty. I approve.”

By now, the others have all gathered around, hoping for blood, no doubt.

Alex rolls again, and this time I make sure four of his dice show one. Because I can.

I rest my hands on my chin and smile as glares at me in frustration. Then I scoop the dice up. I don’t expect Alex to try the same thing twice in a row, but for good measure, I throw a shield up around myself before I roll. I feel magic batting at the shield, but nothing gets through. It’s five sixes again.

“Sixty-zero in my favor,” I tell him. “Your turn.”

“Davy, we need more shots,” Alex says, biding his time. When Davy appears, Alex grabs his arm, pulls him down and whispers something in his ear.

Davy nods and hands us both a glass which we immediately down. “Still waiting, Alex.”

He nods and shakes the dice in his hand before throwing them. I go to flip them, but there’s a shield around Alex, which I take and another around the dice, which I also dismantle, but a second too slow.

Alex smiles broadly. “Thirty-sixty, sis.”

“We’ll see,” I say as I pick up the dice and roll again. Another thirty points to me. “You’re going to have to do better than that.”

“So it would seem. A moment, if you will,” he tells me. He turns and whispers something to Davy, then to Giorgi, then to Peter.

“Got all your ducks in a row?” I ask.

“Let’s find out,” he says picking up the dice.

His strategy is the same as last time, and I’m faster, but so is he. He adds just a little bit of magic to slam the dice down to the table faster than they would fall on their own, and ends up with another five sixes. Damn.

“That’s what sixty-ninety?”

“Not bad,” I comment, sweeping the dice into my hand. With all that whispering, I know he has something planned, I just don’t know what. I roll, and as I do, the ship surges, sending my dice flying off the table and onto the floor. By the time we find them all and check their faces, there are three ones.

“Very nice,” I say, but I’m annoyed. It *was* nice. I should’ve thought of it.

“Um, let’s not break the ship,” Henry comments, warily looking between me and Alex.

“Fine, I promise not to cause a shipwreck if Alex does the same,” I tell him.

Alex nods in agreement. “No shipwrecks,” he says scooping up the dice and rolling.

He layers on a bit more, so now, in addition to everything that came before, I feel Peter, Giorgi, and Davy all working to influence the Dice in Alex’s favor, and I run out of time. Again. Damn!

“Ninety-ninety, sis,” Alex says smirking.

I scoop up the dice and release them in a single move. I don’t bother with any kind of shield. I just throw all of my effort into making sure every dice has a six face-up, no matter where it lands. I put enough power into it that it doesn’t matter what Alex or anyone else in the room does. Enough that it definitely feels a bit chilly in the galley now.

“One twenty-ninety. Last roll.” I have no intention of letting him win. All I need is one die. No limitations. I grin. I got this.

He scoops up the dice, cups them in his hand and gives them a quick shake before releasing them. I see the emotions flicker across his face. He thinks the game has ended in a tie as the dice hit the table. Then it’s replaced by bewilderment as he only counts four sixes. Only four dice. Then it’s incredulity, as he looks from the table to me, and I hold up four fingers.

“You… vaporized one of the dice?” he asks.

“No limitations,” I tell him grinning like the cat that ate the canary.

“Nice,” he tells me appreciatively. “Very nice.”

“Thank you.”

----

It’s many shots later when Davy pops up and asks, “Are you drunk enough yet?”

“Drunk enough for… ?” I ask curiously.

“Dimmi.”

“Where the hell did you get dimmi? But also yes. Definitely.”

“I used to grow it when we all were living together in Leisch. Turns out some of it’s still there.”

“You were growing it and you never told me?” I ask, mildly outraged.

“Of course I didn’t tell you. You would have smoked it faster than I could grow it,” he answers, which fair.

“Dimmi? You guys are going to smoke dimmi?” Michael asks, with what sounds like a hint of reproach in his voice.

“Have you ever tasted colors Michael?” I ask. If you smoke dimmi while sober, it just burns like acid in your lungs. But if you’re drunk enough, dimmi creates a high complete with synesthesia. It’s really the best drug there is. Hard to find though.

He shakes his head.

“You should try it before you knock it,” I tell him.

“But it’s dimmi!” (( this could use some work ))

“And? Davy spends most of his time hanging out with degenerates in dives,” I say.

Gavin waves at Michael, and says, “She’s talking about us, in case that wasn’t clear.”

“Alex has functionally no morals whatsoever, and I’ve never encountered a rule I’m not just willing, but eager, to break. You saw Liam hold a knife to my mother’s throat a couple of days ago. Henry and Lisette decided it sounded like more fun to risk their lives hanging out with us than whatever it is they’d be doing otherwise. We’re basically the people your parents warned you about growing up,” I say with a shrug. “And interestingly, your parents somehow still thought you should come with us.”

I take a long inhale from the pipe Davy passes me before handing it off to Alex. Who takes a drag before passing it off to Liam, who—to my surprise, despite my words—does the same before passing it on.

Maybe we’re all feeling the impending doom. I know I’ve definitely decided that hedonism seems like the best course of action.

By the time it makes its way to Amelia, everyone else has decided they’re game. “Live a little, Michael,” she tells him, taking a hit and handing it to him.

I’m curious to see if he’ll bow to the peer pressure. I see him waver momentarily before he finally says, “Fine.”

Gavin cheers, and soon everyone else is joining him.

“Let’s go topside and taste some colors!” I tell everyone.

----

It’s bright the next morning. So damn bright. It’s the brightness that wakes me up stabbing into my eyes even though they’re still closed. I have no idea what time it is, but based on the way I feel, I’m pretty sure it’s too early. I move to block the sun from my eyes and realize that wherever I am, it’s definitely not a bed, or our cabin. I try to decide if I care, and if it wasn’t for the sun stabbing into my eyes like tiny, little ice picks, I’d just go back to sleep. Even still, I think I might try, until I feel the pillow beneath my head shifting. *No, not a pillow,* I groggily realize. *A person.*

I guess I’d better open my eyes.

When I do, I see that Liam’s lower back is currently serving as my pillow. He’s lying face down on the deck of the ship. Naked. And the view in the morning sunlight is not bad. It’s actually pretty damn good. I’m distracted enough that it takes a few minutes before I realize that, except for the sailcloth someone has draped over me, I’m in the same state. I grin.

It was apparently a very good night.

My last memory is of a strip poker game, that I evidently lost, and then proclaiming that I was going to go climb the foremast.

“Ah, so you’re awake, are you?” someone asks.

“No, definitely not,” I answer the mystery voice.

“Well, do you think you could be not awake somewhere off my deck then?”

I look around trying to find the voice, and finally locate the pilot I was speaking to yesterday.

“Mmm. What happened?”

“You came up here at dawn, on a tear. Saying you were going to climb up into the rigging. No one was willing to grab you to stop you on account of, well,” he says waving at me. “You weren’t lying when you said you could climb. You were onto the main yard quick as could be, not listening to anyone telling you to get your ass back onto the deck until yon man showed up,” he nods toward Liam.

“Him you listened to. Then you came back down and refused to go to your cabin. By that point we were just glad to have you out of our rigging,” he says with a shrug as if that explains everything. “Amazed you didn’t dash your brains all over my deck,” he mutters.

“Please. I could climb that mast while drunk, blindfolded, and stoned in the middle of a gale,” I scoff.

“Aye. You just might be able to at that,” he admits. “Anyway. Whenever you want to get off my deck.”

“Fine, fine,” I grumble to the pilot. “Liam. Hey, Liam.”

“What?” he croaks.

“Ship’s pilot says we’ve overstayed our welcome.”

“Where are we?”

“On the deck. Naked.”

“What happened?”

“We had a *very* good night,” I answer.

### 7 - How Soon Is Now? ^^1300 words^^

A couple of days later, I’m staring over the shoulder of the ship’s pilot, who I’ve since learned is called Lewis—I think it’s a surname, but he didn’t specify and I didn’t ask. I’m peering at his charts and our heading, and it doesn’t look right.

“Where are we sailing?” I ask him.

“Yonder,” he tells me, gesturing vaguely in front of us.

“Yonder, where? This isn’t the right heading to take us to Branton.”

His brow furrows as he casts a glance back my way. “I thought you only knew ‘a bit’ about navigation.”

“I know enough to know this heading isn’t right.” I’m certain of it. “So. Yonder, where?”

“Ask the ice queen.”

“The ice queen? My mother?”

“Aye.”

I close my eyes and take a breath.

“Yonder where, Lewis? I know you know.”

“All I know,” he says, “is that we’re picking up a passenger in Montebal before sailing to Branton.”

“Do you know the passenger’s name?”

“No.”

“How soon until we make port in Montebal?”

“Two days.”

I nod, and walk away to find Davy. A few minutes later, I find him playing cards with Gavin, Peter, and Giorgi.

“Familiar scene,” I say by way of greeting.

“Hey, Hazel,” Gavin responds.

“Hey, Gavin. You guys mind if I steal Davy for a minute?”

Davy narrows his eyes, but stands to walk with me.

I walk towards the stern, and lean on the railing once I find a spot with no one nearby. Davy joins me.

“Well?” he asks.

“I was hanging out with Lewis, the pilot,” I begin. “Looking at his charts and such, and I noticed our heading isn’t quite right.”

“Not ‘quite right’ in what sense?”

“Well, we’re not exactly headed toward Branton. According to Lewis, we’re stopping to pick up a passenger first, then heading to Branton.”

“A passenger?”

“Yeah. He didn’t know who. Just where.”

“Okay, where?” Davy says, asking the obvious question.

“Montebal,” I answer flatly.

“Fuck,” Davy sighs, dropping his head to rest on his hands on top of the railing. “How soon?”

“Two days.”

“Okay.”

“Sorry.”

----

It’s just after noon, almost exactly forty-eight hours later, that we anchor in a protected cove, and a dinghy begins rowing to shore. Lewis knows what he’s about. I’ll give him that.

I wait, staring over the port railing, waiting for chaos incarnate to appear. Alex and Liam stand next to me, and the look Alex wears is as grim as my own. Liam has no idea what’s coming. (( chaos incarnate. Mb change??? ))

Davy isn’t on the deck. He started drinking at breakfast and hasn’t stopped since. Last I checked, Gavin and Henry were keeping him company. Probably still are.

I sigh. At least with my mother, you know what you’re in for. It’s all bad, but you know that, and you’re prepared for it. Christine Iverson is an entirely different kind of nightmare. She can be great. She can make you think you’re the most important person in the world—that the sun rises and sets with you. And then she can be terrible. Maybe she’ll just seem to forget you exist at all. Or maybe she’ll actively work to undermine you or cut you down. Or maybe she’ll abandon you entirely, and leave you at the mercy of someone who would just as soon kill you as feed you. And maybe she’ll show back up in a month, or a year, or a decade. Or maybe not. If she does reappear, maybe you’ll be the most interesting thing in the world to her again for a few days. Or maybe it’ll be like you’ve never met before.

It’s almost worse, because when things are good, you can almost love her. At least until you learn better. And I think Davy’s still trying to figure out exactly how long it takes to learn better.

It’s been fifteen years since he last saw her. The last time she dumped him with us and disappeared, he was seventeen and she never came back. As far as I know, he hasn’t heard a word from her since.

“She’s going to try to sleep with Liam,” Alex says out of nowhere.

“You think?” I ask as Liam snorts in either disbelief or amusement. Maybe both.

“Yeah,” he tells me. “She’s propositioned me before, so…”

“Wow. I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised. And yet.”

“Yeah. I should probably warn the others too,” Alex says with a sigh.

We fall back into silence as the dinghy begins rowing back toward the ship. Another ten minutes and it’s coming alongside the ship and she’s climbing aboard.

She looks older than the last time I saw her, with silver starting to thread through the same dark curls Davy has. She’s still drop dead gorgeous though. When she finally makes it to the deck, I notice that we’re now matched in height. She’ll be the only other person on this ship not having to watch her head as she moves about. Shame.

“Hazel! My darling!” Christine says as she wraps her arms around me. I don’t return her embrace.

She releases me and flings her arms around Alex next. When she releases him she turns an appraising gaze to Liam and asks, “Who is this handsome gentleman?”

“Liam,” he says, introducing himself, “Hazel’s boyfriend.”

“Hmm,” Christine murmurs before casting a speculative glance at me.

One of the ship’s crew comes along to take her to her room, and she leaves without inquiring about Davy at all.

“Well, shall we go warn Davy she’s here?”

Alex nods and we go below deck. We find a very drunk Davy in the galley with Gavin. And at some point between when I saw him earlier this morning and now, he’s cut off all his hair. What was three or four inches of curls is now no longer than the width of a finger. It actually looks better than I would have expected.

“Nice hair. I like it,” I tell him.

“Thanks,” he responds with a nod that would probably have him falling over if Gavin wasn’t propping him up.

“She’s here,” I warn him.

“I don’t care!” he tells us all loudly.

“Yes, we got that from the hair,” Alex remarks drily, with a hint of amusement.

“I don’t!” Davy says again, a bit louder and more emphatic, like that will make it truer.

“We know. Want us to kill her for you?” I ask. I’m only halfway joking.

“Would you?” he asks me.

“Probably,” I answer with a shrug.

“Let me think about it.”

“You do that.”

“I’m going to go warn the others,” Alex says to me and Liam. Then looking at Gavin, he says, “Don’t sleep with Davy’s mom.”

“Got it,” Gavin tells Alex.

“Ugh. I think I might be sick,” Davy mumbles.

I grab an empty pot and shove it at him. “Let’s go get some air,” I say, sliding under his shoulder and relieving Gavin. Slowly we make our way topside. I lead us toward the fourth mast and sit next to it, since I don’t want Davy anywhere near the railings.

“Did she ask about me?” he asks quietly, with his head between his knees.

“No.”

Somehow, he manages to slump a little bit more.

“I shouldn’t care,” he says. “But I do.”

“I know,” I say softly. I don’t need to tell him that his mother is a terrible person. He already knows. It doesn’t matter though.

“I really do like the hair though. It suits you.” We sit in silence for a while before I ask, “Are you going to be okay?”

“I’ll be fine,” he tells me. “We’re always fine, right?”

“Right.”

### 8 - Reasons I Drink ^^2000 words^^

The days on ship go by in a monotonous succession, where one day is much the same as the next. My mother insists that everyone gets together every day, typically in the galley, away from the crew, so she can teach them. Or us? Or me? I’m not even sure who the target of these lessons is, at this point. It’s more nonsense with the energy meridians, except I think it’s percolating into my subconscious and it’s starting to make a terrifying kind of sense. I can feel my own energy meridians, and I think I can feel how they could be manipulated, and it’s like this whole realm of untapped magical potential. It’s making me nervous. Like I need even more power. I want to tell her to stop before some invisible line is crossed. I want to scream it at her until she shuts up, but I can’t. So instead, I sit there every day listening, and my anxiety swells.

I’m sure Liam has noticed, but I don’t think I can explain this growing dread—the unease that has me steps away from a panic attack every second I’m awake. He and Alex have been talking about it. About me. And about Davy. Davy’s been withdrawn since his mother appeared, and we’ve spent more than our fair share of nights atop the main yard, sitting in together silence. Usually drinking. Sometimes not. Lewis has given up and told the rest of the crew to leave us be. I think he’s decided it’s the safest course of action for all parties. He’s not wrong.

I know Liam and Alex both want us to talk. But neither Davy nor I want to. Or are ready to. Or able to.

We’re all a little frustrated with each other, and the close quarters aren’t helping. I think everyone else is experiencing their own mixture of boredom and frustration too. Frustration with my mother’s classes. Frustration with each other. Boredom due to the sameness of every day. We still have at least another two weeks. We all need some space to think and a little room to breathe. And with the exception of the time Davy and I are spending sitting in the rigging, we’re not getting it.

----

It’s probably around three in the morning when I finally climb down, leaving Davy to stare at the stars alone. Lewis is still at the helm. I think the man sleeps even less than I do. It’s actually kind of impressive.

“Good night, Lewis,” I say as I pass him.

He nods in response.

I quietly enter the cabin Liam and I are sharing, shutting the door softly behind me so I don’t wake him. I strip off my clothes and lie down in the dark. But evidently he’s not asleep, or maybe I woke him when I came in, despite trying to be quiet. Either way, he pulls me closer to him when I lie down.

“You’re awake?” I whisper.

“Yeah, can’t sleep.”

“Sorry, I would have come sooner if I’d known.”

“It’s okay,” he says murmurs softly into my hair.

“Why can’t you sleep?” I ask him.

“I’m… worried, I guess, about everything that’s going to happen when we get back to Branton.”

“Yeah, me too. But not worried, so much as filled with dread,” I admit, as I turn to face him.

“Is that what’s going on with you?” he asks, as he pushes my hair back from where it’s fallen into my face, letting his fingers skim across my cheek.

“Yes. No. I don’t know,” I sigh, and say again, “I don’t know. The dread it’s bigger than that. It’s all this stuff with my mother and what she’s teaching everyone.”

“What do you mean?”

“I don’t know. I can’t even really explain it to myself. Or I don’t want to. I don’t know,” I admit, repeating myself, because it’s the only thing I’m really sure of.

“Okay.”

We stay silently entwined in one another’s arms for a few minutes before Liam tells me, “You know Alex is worried about you. And about Davy.”

“I know. We’ll both be fine.”

“Because you’re always fine?”

“Yes.”

“You don’t have to be, you know. Neither does Davy.”

“I know. Is it okay if we don’t talk about it anymore?” I ask. “I just want to lie here with you and not think about it.”

“Alright,” he tells me, pulling me closer, and tucking my head under his chin.

I slowly try to escape from the anxiety that has me firmly locked in its grip, and let the feel of his skin against mine lull me into a dreamless sleep.

----

The next morning Lisette finds me standing behind Lewis. I immediately realize she’s there, but say nothing. One minute turns into five. Then ten. Twenty.

“What are these markings on the chart?” I ask Lewis pointing to an area between the coast of the continent and Kebdain, a large island that’s probably close to a fifteenth the size of the continent.

Lewis glances over to see what I’m pointing at. “Currents meet there. There’s a cold current flowing south and a warm one moving north east. Makes the area dangerous.”

“Do we sail through it or go around?”

“This time of year, we’ll go around,” he tells me.

“What are you doing?” Lisette finally asks me.

“Learning.”

“About sailing?”

“About lots of things.”

It’s true. I’m learning about sailing, and charts, and navigation. But I’m also learning about commanding a ship full of people. Ostensibly this ship has a captain, but he doesn’t matter. Everyone on this ship answers to Lewis, and if it ever came down to it and they were forced to choose between their captain’s orders, or Lewis’s, they would all follow Lewis’s without a second thought given. The really interesting thing though, is that Lewis wouldn’t let it come down to that. He manages the captain just as well as he manages everything else onboard this ship. He’s truly masterful at it. I don’t even think most of the others realize it. Lisette certainly doesn’t seem to.

“Why do we go around this time of year?” I ask Lewis.

“Ice floes, fog, storms. Too many things can go wrong.”

“Do all ships avoid it this time of year?”

“All the smart ones do. Most of the ones that don’t end up on the seafloor.”

“But in the summers you can go through?”

“If you’re careful. Aye.”

“Hmm. What do you make of all this?”

“All what?” he asks carefully.

“This,” I say, gesturing to the ship, Lisette, myself. All of it. “You must have some idea what we’re on about.”

“I know how to mind my business,” he tells me. Clearly wanting to put an end to this particular topic. I decide I’ll let him. For now.

“What do you want, Lisette?” I finally ask her, since she clearly has something on her mind and isn’t going to broach it on her own.

“I want you to do it,” she said quickly, her hands clenched into fists.

“You’re sure?” I ask. “Because you don’t look sure.”

“I’m sure.”

“Fine. But not until we’re off the ship.”

“Why?”

“Lewis, do you want me doing it on your ship?”

“No.”

“He doesn’t even know what ‘it’ is!” Lisette says hotly.

“Doesn’t matter. He said no.”

“He’s just the pilot! It’s not even his ship.”

“Hah!” I snort as I observe the look Lewis gives her. “Well, he certainly won’t be teaching *you* to read the charts. Also, if you think it’s not his ship, you haven’t been paying attention.”

“It’s not my ship,” Lewis says.

“Please. This isn’t your ship the same way these aren’t my people,” I tell him flatly.

Lewis raises his eyebrows slightly, and I think maybe he dips his head minutely in what might be a nod, but I’m not sure.

“Whatever,” Lisette says. “Your mother wants you in the galley.”

“Great,” I mutter as I leave Lewis and head that way.

I find her in the galley, already waiting. Alex, Davy, Liam, and Christine are all there too. Davy is standing as far away from his mother as he can without making it obvious that’s what he’s doing.

“When we return to Branton, you and Davy will gather your things. Then we will all be journeying from Branton to Corriven to take care of the administrative details. From Corriven, you and Davy will go to Dairuvar. Christine will accompany you. Alex and I will go to Avonare,” she says staring at me.

“Fine,” I answer. I knew this was coming. I’ve been waiting. It’s not fine.

“Good,” she remarks, clearly having expected me to argue with her. “Very well. That will be all.”

We file out of the room and Alex looks at me, and asks sharply, “*Fine*? This is not *fine*.”

I shake my head at him. And gesture for them all to follow me, and then I go to find Gavin. When I do, he’s lounging toward the rear of the deck with Peter and Giorgi. Good.

“Hey guys, you busy?” I ask them.

“So busy,” Gavin tells me. “The clouds are very interesting today. We’re keeping a close eye on them.”

“Someone has to,” Giorgi quips.

“Indeed. Well, can you come with me? Lewis, the ship’s pilot would like to have a word with you all.”

This earns me several peculiar looks, but they get up and the seven of us walk toward the helm.

“Hey, Lewis. You said you wanted to talk to these three about spending so much time lying about on your decks,” I say as we approach.

Lewis raises his eyebrows, having definitely said no such thing.

“When he gets done telling you guys off,” I say with a glance to Gavin, “you should ask him about his time with the Firgasu navy. I’m sure he could talk for ages about that.”

“You three are a hazard to the rest of the crew,” Lewis tells them flatly, taking the hint, and I step back a couple of feet with Liam, Davy, and Alex. I make sure to stay close enough to the others that it looks like we could all be involved in the same conversation though, before throwing up a shield around just the four of us.

“No one should be able to hear us,” I tell them, “but keep your voices down just in case. Better safe than sorry.”

“I take it we’re not going to Dairuvar, then,” Liam says.

“No, we’re not even going to Branton, at least not on this ship, but there was no reason to bother telling her that.”

Alex visibly breathes a sigh of relief. “So you haven’t just been spending all your time with Lewis because you’re bored out of your mind?”

“No. I mean, it kind of started out that way, but we can’t go back to Branton with her. Or at least *I* can’t,” I tell them. “Lewis is key to getting off this ship well before that.”

“Does Lewis know this?” Davy asks.

“Not yet. But he’ll help.”

“You’re sure?”

“Yes.”

“Just the four of us?” Liam asks.

“Anyone you don’t mind bringing to the flat, because that’s where we’re all going to need to go.”

“Gavin and Giorgi,” Liam says quickly.

“Peter?” I ask.

Liam looks at Alex, seeking his opinion on, Peter, I guess.

“Yeah, Peter too,” Alex confirms.

“What about Henry, Lisette, and Amelia?” I ask, before quickly stating, “We’re *not* taking Michael.”

“Why not Michael?” Liam asks, and Davy looks curious as well.

I sigh. “He’s been sleeping with Christine.”

“Go figure,” Davy mutters darkly.

“Not Amelia either then. She’s unpredictable at the best of times, but with her loyalties divided like that? No,” Liam tells me.

“And Henry and Lisette?”

“How long before we need to decide?”

“It’ll be about a week until we abandon ship, so to speak,” I answer.

“Think about it until then?” Liam asks us all.

We nod.

“What about Liam?” Alex asks me. “Mom’s going to be pissed when she wakes up and we’re all gone.”

“She won’t kill him,” I say with far more certainty than I feel.

“She might,” Alex says, I think more for Liam’s awareness than mine. “You know how vindictive she can be.”

“If she kills him, she knows she’s next. She’ll have to hold off. Besides, she’ll want to try to figure out how to get us all back under her thumb, and killing Liam won’t accomplish that.”

“Maybe,” Alex says.

“It’s your call Liam,” I tell him.

“We should go,” he agrees. “It’s the least bad option.”

“Alright. I’m going to drop the shield before anyone gets too suspicious.” I don’t warn them all to keep their mouths shut. They’re not stupid.

“So have you ever seen any sea monsters?” I hear Gavin asking Lewis. He shrugs when I look at him in question.

“Sea monsters don’t exist, Gavin.”

“I wouldn’t be so sure, lass,” Lewis says.

I roll my eyes and the conversation continues on.

----

That night, as Davy and I sit together on the main yard, he seems to be in a slightly better mood. After we’ve been up there for an hour or so, silently staring into the night, I feel his magic wrap around us both, and add my own to it.

“We should bring Lisette,” he says after a few moments. “You’re going to need her.”

“How do you figure?”

“You’re not the only one who’s been paying attention to Alexandria’s lessons,” he tells me.

I sigh.

“Yeah. I don’t like it either, but you’re going to need someone to work it out on, and I don’t see a whole lot of other willing volunteers.”

“I know. I’ve been thinking the same thing. For weeks now. And I really don’t like it.”

“I know. So here’s what I’m thinking. If you can actually open her energy meridians, or whatever,” Davy begins, waving a hand in the air.

“I’m pretty sure I can,” I say softly.

“Good. Then when you do, you should make doing so contingent upon letting you do to her what you did to the deer. No,” he says quickly, “don’t look at me like that. She’ll agree. You won’t be taking anything she isn’t willing to offer.”

“I know. I still don’t have to like it though.”

“No, you don’t. But you also can’t afford to give up an advantage.”

I nod, because he’s right. I can’t. I hate it. But I can’t.

“Here’s the real question though,” he says, watching me carefully. “If you can expand them or create them, can you also collapse them?”

“Maybe. I don’t know. I think so. Probably.”

“I think so too. I think it’s worth trying to figure out.”

“Yeah, I know, but again, an issue with the volunteers.”

“I mean, they’re not exactly volunteers, but there are a couple of people on this ship who deserve it.” Davy says flatly.

“True, but I’m not going to try that out until after I’ve done whatever I can do with Lisette, and I’m not doing that until *after* we’re off the ship.”

Davy shrugs. “I’m sure there will be other opportunities.”

“Doesn’t it bother you?” I ask, because it bothers me.

“What?”

“What I’m capable of.”

“No. You don’t want any of it. If you started wanting it, it *might* start bothering me. Maybe.”

“You have a lot more faith in me than I do.”

“I know,” he says. “I always have.”

I don’t bother to contradict him, because he’s right. “I need to go to talk to Lewis,” I tell him, as I quickly move to the mast and back down to the deck.

----

I find Lewis at the helm, because where else would he be?

“Are there two of you?” I ask. “Like, do you have a secret identical twin, because you sleep even less than I do, and I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone who sleeps less than I do.”

“No,” he chuckles as he answers. “But there’s always someone better than you at something.”

“That’s what I’m afraid of,” I mutter. “You never answered me earlier.”

“Didn’t I?” he responds, notably not asking what he neglected to answer earlier.

“You didn’t.” I wait silently just off his shoulder.

Eventually he sighs. “As far as I can tell, you don’t particularly seem to want to be here. Or rather, here with these people. Especially the one who looks like you.”

“My mother,” I say nodding.

“If you can call her that.”

“Yeah.”

We stand silently for a while, the only sounds are the wind creaking through the sails, and the waves slapping against the hull of the ship as it slices through the water.

“I think it’s a bad business,” he says finally. “All of it.”

“Likewise.” I throw my magic around us. “If I wanted to get off this ship before Branton, where would I do it?”

“You? Or you and yours?”

“Me and mine.”

He thinks for a moment, and then moves the chart around, before finally pointing and saying, “Here. Cape Deila.”

I nod. “And when will we reach Cape Deila.”

“About five days from now.”

“At night?”

“If that’s what you want.”

“Sometime between two and three in the morning would be best.”

“What are you going to do when you make land?”

“Start walking.”

He nods. “Long way,” he states.

“I’ve walked further.”

“Have the others?”

I shrug. “They’ll manage.”

“Aye. I expect so.”

### 9 - We’re Going Home ^^1400 words^^

Five nights later, Liam and I stand on the deck with Davy, Alex, and Peter. Gavin and Giorgi have gone to get Henry and Lisette. Davy was right in saying that we should bring Lisette, and if we’re bringing her, then Henry is an obvious choice as well. We didn’t tell either of them beforehand though, which is why Gavin and Giorgi are fetching them now.

Lewis is going to get in as close to the shore of the cape as the barquentine can manage, but we’ll be rowing the dinghy a decent way, and we need to get the timing right. I am waiting very impatiently.

A few minutes later Gavin and Lisette appear, and another minute later, Giorgi and Henry follow. The dinghy is already in the water, and we start climbing down into it. Gavin first, followed by Lisette, Giorgi, then Henry. Peter goes next, and Liam follows him. Then Alex, and Davy.

Lewis hands me a rolled sheet of paper, and says, “Better get going.”

I nod. “Thanks.”

Seconds later, I’m joining the others in the dinghy. Alex and Peter take up the oars, and begin rowing us toward the shoreline.

“What’s that?” Gavin asks, nodding to the rolled sheet of paper I’m holding.

“Not sure,” I tell him sliding it into my pack. It’s too dark to read anything now. There’s a new moon and the sky has a thick, low layer of clouds covering the stars.

Fifteen minutes later, we make it to the shore. So far, so good, but I know it’s only a matter of time and probably not much at that. Eventually she’s bound to notice Liam’s getting further away from her, and when she does…

“Let’s move,” I tell the others. “We’ve got a long way to walk, and the sooner we make it back, the better.”

We’re lucky the coast here isn’t sheer cliffs or thickly wooded, but waist high scrubland. There is no road or trail here, so it’s still rough going, but it could be a lot worse. Lewis chose well.

“How long is it going to take us to make it back to Branton?” Henry asks.

“Probably a few weeks,” Alex answers.

“So they’ll make it back before we do,” Henry says with a nod.

“Still better this way,” Giorgi comments, and I have to agree.

----

I hear Liam take a ragged breath that turns into a strangled gasp after we’ve been walking for a couple of hours. I’m surprised it took this long honestly. I expected it much sooner.

“Stop,” I call out to the others, and drop my pack. I take Liam’s face in my hands. “Stay calm,” I tell him as I stare into his eyes. “She’s not going to kill you. I know it feels like it, but she’s *not* going to kill you.”

“Hazel,” I hear someone say warningly.

“She’s not going to kill him,” I say again. “I’m sure.” I’m not sure. I look back into Liam’s eyes and tell him again, “You’re going to be fine,” as I slowly watch him lose consciousness, and fall to his knees. I hold on to his shoulders to keep him from falling face first into the earth.

*She’s not going to kill him. She’s not going to kill him.* I repeat to myself, again and again, willing it to be true. I wish I was more sure, as one minute stretches to two. And then two minutes stretches to three. I feel my own chest tightening, and begin to worry I was wrong, when he takes a breath. As he does, I finally let out the breath I was holding, and slowly sink to my knees.

“We’ll stay here until he wakes up,” I tell everyone else shortly.

“That was close, sis,” Alex says softly as he settles beside me.

I only nod, because I’m not sure I can say anything else without my voice shaking and giving me away. I take my pack and slide it under Liam’s head, as Alex helps me move him onto his back.

“He’ll be fine,” Alex says.

I just nod, and curl up next to Liam, hating that I’m the sort of person who’s willing to gamble with his life.

“You did the right thing, Hazel.”

“I wasn’t sure,” I admit softly.

“But you were right.”

----

At some point, I must have fallen asleep because daylight has replaced the slow creep to dawn and I hear birdsong in the distance. I see Liam and Peter several feet away talking quietly. Peter notices I’m awake first and says something to Liam that has him quickly looking in my direction. Liam nods and claps Peter on the shoulder, then heads back to me.

“Are you okay?” I ask as he reaches me.

“I’m fine. Are you?”

“Can we talk about it later?” I really don’t feel like answering that question with a single modicum of honesty in the middle of a group of people.

“As long as you’ll actually talk to me about it later.”

I nod and reach for my pack. Now that it’s daylight, I want to see what the paper Lewis handed me has on it. Unrolling it, I see it’s a chart of the land where we are, and he marked out a route back to Branton that looks like it will be faster than what I likely would have picked with no reference material to go off of.

“Anyone have a compass?” I ask. I could probably wing it well enough without one, but having one would definitely be better.

“Yes,” Peter begins digging around his pack. “Here,” he says, tossing me a compass.

“Excellent. Where are Gavin, Giorgi, and Henry?” I ask, ready to get moving.

“Checking the snares,” Peter tells me.

“Snares?”

“We’ll need food. Giorgi and Gavin set snares after we stopped.”

“Ah. Good idea.” I don’t bother mentioning that I could simply lure some animals to their deaths, because it *was* a good idea, and I don’t know how long it would have taken for me to get hungry enough to bother. Certainly well after everyone else.

I should have them show me how the snares work next time we stop. Could be useful.

Ten or fifteen minutes later, the three of them are filtering back in, carrying five rabbits. Definitely useful. They skin and butcher the rabbits quickly, and within the hour we’re all eating. I’m studying the chart Lewis left me, and even on the shortened route he mapped out, it still leaves us about four hundred miles to get back to Branton. If we manage twenty miles a day, it’ll take us twenty days to get back. That’s too long. At twenty file miles a day, we’ll make it back in sixteen, which is better but still longer than I would like. Ideally, we would be back now.

“We need to cover at least twenty file miles a day,” I tell the others. I’m annoyed that actual teleportation is beyond the bounds of what magic is capable of. Sure, I could approximate something that looked like it over a very short distance, but the energy requirements over any sizable distance for a group of people would be astronomical. I’d die before I could manage it, and so would everyone and everything around me.

Oh well. Getting off the ship was still the least bad choice.

“Lisette,” I say, and wait for her attention to shift to me. “Tonight?” I’d just as soon get this over with.

“Okay,” she nods.

I sigh internally. I think I was hoping she’d say no, and back out. Maybe she still will, but I doubt it. Great.

“Let’s go,” I say as soon as everyone is done eating.

The terrain is rough. We’re not quite bushwhacking, but we’re not far off from it either. We’re probably covering about two and half miles an hour, so we’ll be hiking into the dark, which means we’ll be moving even slower. All in all, it’ll probably take us fourteen hours to cover the twenty-five miles, and that’s if we don’t stop for breaks. I try to increase the pace, but in less than an hour, the others are telling me to slow down.

### 10 - King of Pain ^^2200 words^^

Everyone is tired by the time we stop for the night. I can see the strain in their faces, and I know at least a few of them probably have some blisters that need tending. I leave that for Alex to deal with. He’s not exactly *better* at it than I am insofar as the end result will be the same. But it will hurt less if Alex does it. I’ve never been able to completely stop an injury from hurting while I heal it. Probably because I don’t care. If it hurts, it hurts. Eventually it will stop.

Gavin, Giorgi, and Henry are going off to set some snares. I want to go with them. Instead, I sit down and wait for Lisette. A few minutes later she’s standing in front of me.

“Let’s do it,” she says.

“Okay. Sit. I want to explain some things before we do this.”

“Are you going to try to talk me out of it?” she asks.

“No, but I want to make sure you know what you’re signing up for.”

She finally sits down, and as she does, Peter comes over and sits across from us to listen. I ignore him. Liam sits next to Peter, and Alex and Davy come and sit to either side of me. Great. I have an audience. I sigh.

“So first of all, this is going to hurt. Probably a lot.”

“How much is a lot?”

“You remember back in the clearing, in Leisch?” I ask.

She nods.

“What we did there was like a heavily modified version of this. Davy was moving energy through me, and it hurt. A lot. And my meridians, or whatever,” I hate how it sounds saying ‘energy meridians’ aloud, but I also don’t have a better term, “are actually… open? I guess. As far as I can tell, yours aren’t. So we need to open them, or maybe create them. I’m not sure. Anyway. I expect that’s going to hurt a lot more. *A lot more.* It will easily be the most painful thing you have ever experienced. And maybe if I had done this before, I could mitigate that. But I haven’t, and I’m not even going to try.” I tell her simply.

“That’s the second thing. It should go without saying, but I’m going to say it anyway, just so we’re clear: I have never done this before. It might work. It might not. It might kill you. But regardless of what the outcome is, I can guarantee it’s going to be painful.

“Here’s the third thing. The thing I really want you to think about before we do this. This is going to bind you to me. Permanently. If it works, it’s going to make it so that I can pull power through you forever.”

“But I’ll also be able to move it through myself?” she asks.

“If it works. Yes. *If* it works.”

“Okay. Let’s do it.”

It’s exactly what I knew she was going to say. Exactly what I was afraid she was going to say.

“Alright. Give me a couple of minutes to talk to Davy and Alex,” I tell her, standing. I jerk my head to the left, and they both follow me as I start moving.

Once the three of us are a couple dozen feet away from the others, I put up a shield to stop our conversation from traveling back to them.

“Is anyone else nervous about how much she wants this?” I ask Davy and Alex.

Alex nods in agreement. “Yes.”

“If someone had just given me that speech, I think I’d have a little bit more hesitancy,” I comment.

“You’re right, and it’s not ideal, but I think you should still do it. She’s what we’ve got to work with. Just make damn sure that connection is a one way connection,” Davy tells me.

I nod, having already thought the same. I’m actually planning on doing one better, and weaving into the magic something that will kill her outright if she tries to draw power from me or otherwise modify the bond. I have enough doubts about this whole thing that I want to be as sure as I can. And it doesn’t feel nearly sure enough. But I’m still going to do it. Maybe Peter was right. Maybe I do like playing with fire. Maybe I do want to see how close I get with without getting burned.

Eventually I know I’m going to go up in flames though. A great, spectacular conflagration. I just hope this isn’t it.

“Okay. Can I get one of you guys to hold her in place? Still-still. Barely breathing still. I don’t want to have to split my attention doing that as well.”

“Yeah, I’ll do it,” Alex tells me.

“Thanks.” I sigh. “Davy, can you make sure no one interferes? I don’t think anyone will, but just make sure.”

He nods.

“Well, I guess there’s nothing to it but to do it,” I say before letting the shield fall and walking back to Lisette.

I sit back down in front of Lisette. “Alex is going to hold you in place while we do this,” I tell her. “I need to make sure you’re still, and I don’t think you’ll be able to stay still without someone forcing you to.”

I wait for her to nod, and then wait until I feel Alex’s power wrap around her before I take her hands in mine. I close my eyes, and instead of falling backward into myself, like I normally would, I focus on falling inward to the spot where her hands are resting against mine.

From here, I begin the first tentative steps of binding her to me, and send my power questing into her, along where I think her energy meridians should be. And I feel them. Kind of. But instead of being like paths or grooves throughout her body, they feel like faint hairline cracks. But at least there’s something there to work with. I won’t have to burn them into her from nothing, which might make it hurt a little less. Probably not much, though. I start pulling power into myself and sending it through my hands into hers, using it to burn the cracks into channels, and it feels a lot like burning patterns into wood, only instead of wood, it’s the being of another person. I try to make them similar to what I think exists in Gavin and Henry—not as deep or as wide as what I think they’re like in the rest of us.

I know if Alex wasn’t holding her locked in place, she would be screaming and thrashing in pain right now. But I keep going. I told her this is what it would be like, and still she asked for it, so I keep going.

I don’t know how long it’s been, or how much longer it’s going to take. I just keep pulling power into myself and using it to burn through her. I feel my own skin growing hot where our hands meet, but I ignore it and continue working. A part of me is distantly aware that Lisette has lost consciousness—which is probably a mercy—though Alex still holds her in place, but I’m nowhere near done.

So far, I’ve just been pushing power into her, etching the pathways that will allow it to flow. Now I begin pulling it through her, and using it to bind her to me, similar to what I did with the deer. I remold parts of Lisette to be more like myself, and force her body to accept the changes I’m making as I do so. I wrap the changes tighter and tighter so that the only way the power can flow is through her and into me. I layer on more magic, so that if Lisette—or anyone else—tries to use the connection to pull power from me, it’ll result in Lisette’s death. I hope it won’t be necessary, but I’m unwilling to chance it so I put more power into that piece than any other part of what I’ve done to her.

Self preservation is real.

Finally, everything is in place, and I hold it there until it sounds like a note being stretched to its breaking point. Then I let it all crystalize and release it. I think I feel reality actively reshaping itself.

I open my eyes and take a breath. Hold it, then begin pulling power through Lisette, and neither of us dies as I do so. That part of the magic, at least, is solid and stable. We’ll have to see what the rest is like when she wakes up. If she wakes up.

“You can let her go, Alex,” I tell him and he catches her as she slumps forward.

I’m not exactly sure how much time has passed, but enough the others have come back from setting snares, and someone built a fire.

My hands are still hot, and it feels like I’ve burned them. Damn. Alex notices me looking at them, and grabs them before I can yank them away.

“All good?” Liam asks.

“I don’t know. We’ll find out when she wakes up,” I say as I pull my hands away from Alex and rise to my feet. “Giorgi, can you show me how you set the snares?”

“Sure.”

I follow him as he gets up and walks away. About a hundred yards away he stops and kneels in front of a snare, undoing whatever he did to set it up in the first place. He walks me through the process of setting it up, and then hands it to me. It’s impressively simple for something that caught five rabbits. Just some wire twisted around itself into a sliding loop, and suspended between two sticks at rabbit level. But once you’re caught in it, tightens down the more you struggle to get free of it. It feels like a metaphor for my life right now.

“Are the snares the only reason we’re out here?” Giorgi finally asks, once I’ve finished resetting it.

“No, but I did want to see how they worked. Where’d you get the wire from?”

“Took it off the ship. Figured it would come in handy.”

I nod. “Can you keep an eye on Lisette for a while? Once she wakes up?”

“Yes. Why?”

“I am… concerned by how desperately she wanted this.”

I don’t bother supplying more detail, and Giorgi doesn’t ask. I’m not sure if that’s because he understands why, or if he doesn’t care, and I don’t care enough to ask. Just as long as someone has eyes on Lisette.

He nods. “I can do that.”

“Thanks. Do we have any food for tonight?”

“Not much.”

I sigh. There’s a deer not far away, but that would be a waste. “Where are the other snares?”

“There are three more further along this game trail.”

I grab his arm and pull him to the side. I force my awareness out of myself until I find some rabbits, and then I encourage them to come down this trail. A few minutes later one comes racing down the trail and hits the snare I’ve just reset. It’s going fast enough that its neck snaps.

“Huh. At least it’s fast,” I say.

“If they hit the snare quickly enough,” Giorgi says with a nod.

“Let’s go get the others.”

His eyebrows lift slightly in surprise. “Are you going to explain how you did that?”

“There are at least seven deer within a mile of us. Can you feel them?”

He shakes his head.

“Figure out how to feel them first, and then I’ll explain.”

“How do I do that?”

“It’s like… if you had eyes and ears all over. You make all of your senses bigger until you can feel where the deer are, almost like if you could just see them in the distance. It’s hard to explain. I think you kind of just have to work it out.”

He nods.

We go get the remaining rabbits, resetting the snares as we do. When we walk back to the others, Gavin and Henry look mildly surprised, but they’re the only ones.

I leave the butchering and cooking of the rabbits to whomever’s willing to do it, and go lean up against Liam who wraps an arm around me. We need tents and some gods damned privacy, but it doesn’t seem like we’re going to have any of that for the next couple of weeks. I sigh.

“Are you okay?” Liam murmurs.

“I don’t know,” I answer softly. “I want to go throw rocks at shit,” I admit. But like the tents, there are no bottles to throw rocks at. There aren’t even any rocks unless I want to waste energy digging them out of the dirt.

There’s not much to say to that, so Liam only nods, and we sit around the fire in silence. I would just as soon keep walking until we get to Branton, even if expending the energy to do so would be stupid. The fact that the others can’t is the only thing really stopping me.

### 11 - Pepper ^^1900 words ^^

The next morning Lisette doesn’t wake up. She’s breathing and her pulse is fine, so I’m not too concerned about it. I’m just annoyed. We can’t afford to lose an entire day, or however long it’s going to take, waiting for her to wake up.

“We’re going to have to carry her,” I tell the others.

“Over this terrain?” Henry asks uncertainly.

“Yeah. Liam, Peter, Alex, you guys are the biggest. What do you have for extra clothes?” I ask.

“Not much,” Peter says, pulling out a spare shirt and pair of pants.

“Hand them over,” I tell him, and wait for Alex and Liam to do the same. Once I’ve got all their spare clothes, I begin knotting them together into something resembling a sling.

Alex sighs. “Well there’s no way I’m going to be able to wear those again, Hazel.”

I shrug. “If you have a better idea of how to carry her for the next twenty five miles, I’m all ears.”

“I don’t know. How about a litter?”

“Made from what? Green wood? It’d probably be close to half again her weight, and we’d still need something to lash it together.”

“Fine. Whatever,” he grumbles because he knows I’m right.

Once I’ve got something I think will hold her, I say, “We’ll pair off by height. Me and Davy. Henry and Giorgi. Gavin and Alex. Peter and Liam. A mile at a time, then switch?”

Everyone nods in agreement.

“Okay, help me get her into this thing.”

Eventually Davy and I are standing, holding the knotted ends of the sling at our shoulders, with Lisette slumped suspended between us in something like a seated position.

“Are you guys sure you can manage that?” Gavin asks skeptically.

“Better than you,” I tell him with a snort. “Let’s go.”

They all let Davy and I go first to set the pace.

----

By the end of the day, we’ve all had at least six turns carrying Lisette, and I can tell everyone is sick of it, but no one is complaining, even though it took an extra three hours to cover the same distance today as it did yesterday.

“I’ll go see about some food,” Giorgi says, when we finally decide on a stopping point.

I look at him in question, and he shrugs.

“Let us know if you need some help,” I tell him. I guess we’ll see what happens.

He nods and goes off into the brush.

“What are you teaching my brother?” Gavin asks.

“How to stay alive. Hopefully,” I mutter as I slump back onto my pack and stare up at the sky. Everyday we’re not in Branton feels like a missed opportunity, an advantage that we’re giving away.

After what feels like twenty minutes or so, Giorgi comes back with two rabbits. Not half bad for a first attempt.

Liam drops to sit next to me, and I immediately move a little bit closer and interlace my fingers with his. Everyone’s exhausted, so we all sit silently while Alex builds a fire and Davy and Henry set about butchering the rabbits.

“So how much longer are we going to carry her?” Gavin asks, nodding to Lisette.

“I have no idea. If we’re lucky she’ll wake up tomorrow,” I answer.

“So you’re saying we’ll definitely be carrying her tomorrow,” Gavin says.

I look at him in question.

“When are we ever that lucky?”

I sigh. “You’re probably right.”

----

In the evening two days later, after another fifty miles of us carrying her through the scrubland, Lisette finally wakes up.

“What happened?” she asks groggily.

“You’ve been unconscious for about three days,” Gavin says. “We’ve been *carrying* you for three days.”

I grin. You can always count on Gavin to relay the most important information first. I’ll give him that.

“Oh,” Lisette says, looking somewhat abashed. “Did it work?” she asks, looking at me.

“I have no idea,” I tell her. “You’re not dead,” I shrug. “Beyond that, I have no idea. Even if it did, you’re still going to have to figure out how it works. Start with the knot again.”

“Start with walking again,” Gavin mutters, and I can’t help but laugh. I’m just as sick of carrying her as everyone else.

Davy appears and hands her a waterskin and some food. Acting like a real person instead of like Gavin and me, who I guess just expected her to get up and get it herself. She quickly drains the waterskin. A few days of unconsciousness will do that to a person.

After she eats what Davy handed her, she quickly begins messing with the fabric knot, which does nothing to quell my uneasiness. While the learning experience was worthwhile, and perhaps even necessary, I am increasingly feeling like I will live to regret this. But at the same time, I think had I not done it, Lisette would have found a way to make me regret that as well. Damned if I did and damned if I didn’t. Story of my life.

I get up and go to find Liam. He’s next to the stream we’ve stopped by for the night, with Alex and Peter. I think Liam and Peter are trying to work out how to catch some fish, and I think Alex is just there to laugh at them, which fair. And since I would sooner go hungry than eat fish, I’m not going to volunteer any tips either.

“Hey Liam, walk with me a bit?” I say as I approach them, extending my hand to him.

He nods and steps away from the stream.

“What’s up?” he asks once we’ve moved out of earshot of the others.

“Can’t I just want a little alone time with you?” I ask in response.

He stops moving forward and spins me around to face him, catching my other hand in his, before bringing his mouth to meet mine. My lips eagerly part beneath his, and as his tongue slides over mine I press myself more firmly against him and he releases my hands, sliding his to my waist. Mine immediately wrap around him pull him closer to me. His hands move down to my hips and then over my ass, before he lifts me up, and I wrap my legs around him. I can feel the heat coming off of him as I slip my tongue into his mouth, deepening our kiss. I manage to work my hands under his shirt when he gently pulls back panting.

“This isn’t what you had on your mind when you asked me to walk with you,” he says.

“Well it damn sure is what I have on my mind now,” I say kissing him again, my own breathing sounding just as ragged.

He pulls back though, and I’m forced to say, “This now. Talking later. Please, Liam. Please,” I repeat again, beseechingly, when he doesn’t move.

Finally his mouth is on mine again, as hungry for me as I am for him. His hand slips beneath my shirt to the small of my back, and I moan softly, which brings a new urgency to his movements. He sets me down so that he can pull off my shirt, and I strip off his clothes just as quickly. His teeth find my nipple and gently nip at it. I wind one hand through his hair to keep me balanced and on my feet and wrap my other around his dick. He gasps as he brings his mouth back to mine. After a moment, I pull away and skim my lips over his jaw, before moving down his neck to his chest. I let my tongue trace over the ridges of his ribs, and the muscles of his stomach as I drop to my knees, and slide the head of his penis into my mouth, moving my tongue over him languidly. The sound he makes as his hands tangle in my hair is enough to make me never want to stop, and I take him deeper into my mouth, working my tongue along the length of him. I keep going as his breathing becomes rough and rougher. In one quick motion, he pulls me from my knees, lifting me into the air, and spinning us around so that my back is against the nearest tree, as he thrusts into me. I find his mouth with my own to keep from shouting out in pleasure because there’s definitely nothing shielding the sound right now, and we’re not that far from everyone else. But I definitely don’t have the ability to do anything about that right now. Liam is the only thing I can focus on as he thrusts into me again and again.

I’m nearly there when he drops his hand to trace across my clit as he continues to drive into me. It’s enough to push me over the edge, and I lock my legs around him holding him tight to me as I convulse around him, which is enough to pull him over with me.

He holds me against the tree for a few minutes as we both catch our breath and come down from the high. Eventually though, he slowly lowers me to my feet, and I immediately miss his body pinning mine in place.

“Let’s just stay here for a while,” I whisper.

“Okay,” he agrees, moving our clothes so we can lie on top of them before he pulls me to his chest. “So what did you want to talk about?” he asks after a few minutes.

“Hmm?”

“Before,” he says. “When you came to find me. What did you want to talk about?”

“Oh.” I sigh. “Lisette. We can’t take her to the flat, Liam.”

“Why not? Is something wrong?”

“I’m not… I don’t know. She woke up, and she seems fine but…” I trail off.

“But?”

“She wants it all too much,” I say softly. “It’s not normal. It makes me really, really uneasy. And maybe it will be fine and nothing will come if it, but…”

“But you don’t think, so. Okay,” he says, running his hand along my spine. “We’ll figure out something else. We’ve got time.”

“Okay, good.” I close my eyes and enjoy the moment. It’s the first one we’ve had alone in days, and I had no idea how much I needed it. “I love you. Let’s just stay here forever,” I murmur.

“I love you too, but you would get bored,” Liam tells me.

“I think you could help with that.”

We lie there together until I hear Alex shouting, “Hazel! Liam! Don’t make me come find you!”

I sigh. “We’d better go back. He’ll definitely make good on that threat if we don’t.”

We stand up and begin to sort out whose clothes are whose, tugging them on as we go.

Finally we make our way back to the others. When we get there Alex takes one look at us, his eyes shifting between Liam and me. “Gods, this is so weird,” he mutters before walking away.

I look at Liam, and we both shrug.

“Sounds like a you problem,” I call after Alex.

“Never said it wasn’t,” he tosses back over his shoulder.

I look for Lisette, and find her still fiddling with the knot, but she’s actually close now, and I can’t help but sigh. I really hope I’m wrong, and I’m pretty sure I’m not.

### 12 - It’s Called Freefall ^^2100 words^^

We spend the next twelve days walking. It’s monotonous, but at least we’re dong something. Lisette peppers me with questions about magic throughout the process. I don’t think I’ve ever spent so much time talking about it in my life. To say she’s infatuated would be understating the matter.

I’m doing my best to remain detached from the whole thing. Either she’s going to get herself killed, I’m going to kill her, or everything will work itself out, and there’s no reason to dwell on it now that I’ve established the basic parameters of the situation. Alex and Davy both know the situation, and I’m pretty sure Giorgi’s worked it out as well. I’m not sure about the others, but if they haven’t, they haven’t been paying attention.

“So what did you do to get us through the pass?” Lisette asks, and I feel all eyes except Davy, Alex, and Liam turn to me.

“Magic,” I answer, hoping it will be enough and knowing it won’t.

“Yes, but what? And how?”

I consider my words carefully. There’s no good answer to this question. If I tell her what I did, she’s going to start trying to work it out herself. If I tell her it’s nothing she’s going to be able to replicate, she’s not going to believe me, and I’m pretty sure she’ll resent both me and the implications, and start trying to work it out herself.

“It’s nothing I want to explain to anyone who doesn’t already know the details,” I tell her in a tone that should make it clear I’m unwilling to discuss it.

“But—”

“No, Lisette. There are no buts. It’s an off limit topic of conversation.”

“But—”

“Lisette, she said no,” Henry says. “Drop it. You’re alive. That should be good enough.”

“But—”

“Lisette, shut the hell up.” This comes from Gavin, who goes on to say, “Everyone is sick of listening to you bug Hazel about magic. Her most of all, I’m sure,” he mutters.

“Wait, really?” she asks.

“Yes. Notice how you’re the *only* talking about it?” Gavin questions.

“Oh.”

We walk in silence for a while after that, and eventually Alex moves next to me, and then begins falling a back slightly, so I shorten my stride to match his until we’re trailing behind the others by several yards. After a few more minutes, I feel his magic wrap around us both.

“She’s still thinking about it,” he tells me softly. “All the time. All I’ve felt coming from her since she woke up is desire for magic.”

I nod. It’s about what I suspected. “I’m not surprised,” I eventually say. “What do you think the chances are she’s able to figure out how to manage it?”

“Not high,” he says. After thinking about it for a minute, he goes on to add, “Maybe twenty percent. Maybe less.”

“Yeah.”

“So what are you going to do?”

“Wait and see?” I shrug.

“Might not be the best course of action.”

“Maybe, but what’s the alternative?”

“Stop the problem, that we all know is going to be a problem, before it can become a problem?”

“Be my guest,” I tell him, “but unless you’re willing to do it, I’m going to give her a chance.”

“I might.”

I shrug. I’d be lying if I said the thought hadn’t crossed my mind as well.

“A slip and fall down a ravine here might be safer than letting her back into a city full of people.”

“I’m aware. Listen, I’m not going to stop you. But I’m also not going to kill her on a maybe. We’d both be dead a hundred times over if that’s the standard we’re using.”

He sighs, but lets his magic fall away, and we being catching back up to the others.

----

“What was that about earlier?” Liam asks later when we’re alone.

“What?”

“The hushed conversation you and Alex were having.”

“Oh. That.” I sigh. “He’s concerned about Lisette.”

“He’s concerned. You’re concerned. I assume Davy is also concerned?”

“Yes.”

“Should I be concerned?” he asks.

“Probably,” I mutter, avoiding his eyes.

“How concerned?”

I debate not answering. I consider not quite lying. Ultimately I decide to just admit where things stand. “Pretty concerned. Alex thinks we’d be smart to kill her now, rather than risk her in a city full of people.”

“Shit.”

“Yeah.”

“And what’s your take?”

“My vote is to give her enough rope to either hang herself, or figure out how to climb back up. But I told Alex if he disagrees, I won’t stop him. For now though, I think he’s willing to wait and see.” I’m quiet for a minute, before finally saying, “People like her are the reason everyone is scared of people like us. Right now, I don’t think there’s anything she wouldn’t do for a little bit more power, and I mean just for the sake of more power.”

----

The next day, we begin to see signs of habitation again. There are small farmsteads and streams of smoke rising from chimneys in the distance. Halfway through the day, we could journey by actual road if we desired, but I’m unwilling to chance it. Based on where we got off the ship, this is the only logical direction we would come from, so if someone is looking for us, that road is the one they would be watching. I don’t know if anyone is, but I feel like we’d be idiots to assume they aren’t.

“No magic,” I tell the others. “At least not until we’re back in Branton. There’s a chance they could use it to find us,” I add, thinking about how Liam’s magic works. And I’m pretty sure I could do it if I tried.

I get nods of acknowledgment from everyone but Lisette. “Lisette?”

“Yeah. Okay. Fine.”

I look at Giorgi only to find him already watching me. He nods.

We both keep a close eye on Lisette for the rest of the day, and the more I watch her, the more certain I become: she’s going to run tonight. If she does, I can’t let her go back to Branton. It’ll be the deciding factor.

She didn’t like it when I called for a moratorium on magic, the same as she didn’t like it when I wouldn’t answer her questions about the pass. She wants to do what she wants to do, and everyone else be damned, and that’s the single most dangerous attitude for her to have. Not necessarily for her, but for everyone around her.

When we stop for the night, I make sure to pick a spot close to Lisette, and I see Giorgi, Alex, and Davy have done the same. Apparently we’re all expecting her to run tonight.

After a bit, Giorgi and Davy both disappear into the woodlands, and Alex and I stay near Lisette.

“So, what’s everyone looking forward to when we get back?” I ask in an attempt to distract Lisette from her own stupidity.

“Beds,” Henry says wistfully.

“Beds are nice,” Peter says, “but I’ll be happy to not spend everyday walking from sunup until sundown.”

“Eating something besides rabbit. If I never eat rabbit again, it’ll be too soon,” Gavin comments.

“You’re not wrong about that,” Alex says, nodding in agreement.

“Lisette? What about you?” I ask.

“I don’t know,” she says, clearly distracted.

I hear Alex sigh.

“What about you, Hazel?” Peter asks.

“It’s a tie between privacy and churros,” I say glancing toward Liam. “I can feel you rolling your eyes, Alex.”

“Yeah, I’ve got to go with privacy,” Liam says.

----

It’s close to two in the morning when Lisette finally makes her move, slinging her pack over her shoulder and creeping away from the rest of us. Once she’s got a bit of a lead on me, I get up and follow her.

“Going somewhere, Lisette?” I ask, once we’re several hundred feet away from the others. I know Giorgi and Davy are still out here somewhere, and I assume Alex is somewhere behind me.

She jerks to a stop, clearly not having realized I was following her. She lets her pack fall from her shoulder as she turns to face me.

“Back to Branton,” she says.

“Well, that’s good since we’re all going there, we can just keep going together.”

“No, I can’t. I need to go now.”

“Why?” I ask her.

“I just do.”

“The magic?”

“I just need to.”

“I can’t let you, Lisette. I really wish I could but I can’t. Do you understand how dangerous you are right now? The magic has been the only thing you’ve been thinking about since you woke up. Even before that, probably. Am I right?” I’m pretty sure I’m right.

“Yes,” she admits.

“Come back and we’ll try to figure something else out.” I honestly don’t even have the faintest idea of what ‘something else’ could be, but I will try to figure it out if she comes back. I know she won’t though.

“No,” she confirms for me, shaking her head.

“I can’t let you go on your own, Lisette,” I reiterate.

Taking the statement for what it is, she starts toward me. Lisette has seven or eight inches on me, and probably a solid sixty pounds. Maybe more. So there’s no hesitation on my part when I draw a knife from its sheathe. I could kill her in a second with magic, but when I told the others no magic, I meant it. I send my right arm back and release the stone I’ve had cupped in my palm throughout the conversation at her head. It hits her just above her left eyebrow, splitting the skin and sending blood streaming into her left eye.

I draw a second knife and close the distance between us. I duck under her arms as I get close and send a knife into her ribs. Unfortunately, it hits bone and skates along, leaving a nasty gash that is definitely not life threatening. I kick out at her right knee as I move past. I hear a popping crunch that definitely sounds like it’s done some damage as I make contact. When I come up though, her right fist slams into my life cheekbone, sending me staggering back a couple of steps before I’m able to rebalance and slide to the side. My head is definitely ringing, and I think the skin on my cheek is split open. But at least whatever blood is coming from the cut is flowing down my face and not into my eye. I move to Lisette’s left hoping for an advantage, and sink a knife into her left side.

When I do, I feel her begin to pull energy into herself. I was hoping to end this before she had a chance to use any magic. I twist the knife in left side then yank it out it as I slide around behind her. Once behind her, I drive both knives into her throat from opposite sides, and release them as she falls to her knees, with blood pulsing darkly from around each knife.

“Fuck,” I mutter softly as I remove the knives and the pulsing blood ebbs to a slow trickle. I wait until I’m reasonably sure she’s gone, and then I plunge a knife into her heart for good measure. I’ve survived wounds I should have been able to before, so I see no reason to chance her doing the same.

I wrap my fingers around her wrist searching for a pulse. When I’ve counted to two hundred without feeling one. I wipe my knives off on her clothes as best I can before sheathing them and rising to my feet.

I see Davy and Giorgi approaching from the south and turn to find Alex waiting to the north. Fuck.

Alex makes it to me first and starts to reach for my face.

“Don’t touch me,” I tell him sharply, and he snatches his hand back.

He tears a piece of cloth from his shirt and hands it to me instead. “It might scar,” he tells me as I press it to my face.

“Yeah, well. It would serve me right,” I mutter darkly.

“For which part? Letting her punch you in the face, or letting her have magic in the first place?” he asks as Davy and Giorgi reach us.

“All of it,” I answer grimly. I’m pissed. “Let’s go back. We all need to move. She started pulling power into her. If anyone was looking for us, she might have just given our position away.”

“What do you want to do with her?” he asks.

“Leave her. We don’t have time. We need to start circling around, and change the direction we’re approaching from.”

“Alright. We’ll sort the others,” Alex says, and Davy and Giorgi nod in agreement.

“Fine,” I say, pressing the cloth into my face a little bit harder. It stings. Serves me gods damned right.

### 13 - The Monster  (( or Bad Guy?? Here ?? )) ^^2200 words^^

I’m the last one back up the hill to where the others are sleeping. By the time I get there, Alex has woken everyone up, and Davy is barking out instructions. I stand there silently wondering how much blood is visible on my clothing right now. It probably doesn’t matter because I’m sure the streaks on my face are pretty clear. I wish I could get Lisette’s blood off me, but I meant it when I said no magic.

Alex comes over carrying a waterskin. “Hands out,” he orders.

I don’t argue, just hold them in front of me and allow him to pour water over them as I do my best to scrub off the blood.

Fuck.

I notice Davy in the background now talking to Liam as Liam watches me. I close my eyes. Fuck.

“It’s fine, sis.”

It is not fine. Least fine is the fact that except for this last bit, I’d do it all again, because Davy was right. The only thing I would have changed, retrospectively, would have been to slit her throat before she ever woke up. It is so fucking far from fine it’s laughable. I resist the urge though, because the last thing everyone else needs is to see me standing here, covered in Lisette’s blood, laughing. Fuck.

I open my eyes back up. Davy is still talking to Liam. I have no idea what he’s saying, and I can’t quite make myself care right now.

“Alex, we need to move.”

“I know. Another minute isn’t going to hurt anything, Hazel. We don’t know if anyone else is coming, but even if they are, we’ll be gone before they get here.”

“They’re coming,” I tell him.

His eyes flick to mine and see the urgency there.

“Okay,” he says, shoving my pack into my arms. “Everyone up,” he calls out to the others. “We’re going now. No magic and everyone is running.”

I let out a sigh of relief, which quickly dies when I hear someone, I think Henry, ask, “Where’s Lisette?”

“She decided to leave,” someone, maybe me, answers.

----

We been running for over an hour when someone asks if we can stop. I apparently didn’t hear the question the first time it was asked.

“Hazel,” Alex says getting my attention, “do we need to keep running?”

“Yes.”

I’m to the far right of the group. Alex is to my left, and Davy is just ahead of him, and Giorgi is just behind. I think they’re keeping the others away from me, I’m not sure, and I don’t really care. No one has been talking to me, and that’s good enough.

Alex asks the same question again an hour later, and this time I agree that we can slow to a walk. Whatever’s behind us no longer feels quite so imminently threatening.

Sometime later, when the sky has begun to lighten Liam evidently decides enough time has passed and starts to move toward me. Alex, Davy, and even Giorgi all block him out, each of them silently looking to me to decide that I’m ready to deal with him. Finally I notice and nod, and they fall away slightly as Liam edges closer.

“I don’t want to talk about it,” I tell him before he has a chance to ask any questions.

“Okay,” he agrees walking next to me in silence.

We cover the miles throughout the day rapidly, and when we’re within ten or fifteen miles of the city proper, Davy calls a halt, and spends a few minutes talking with Liam and Peter. Alex stays near me, and Giorgi is talking to Gavin and Henry. I think he’s trying to keep them from asking me questions which, if so, I appreciate. I’m going to have to thank him later. It’s bound to be awkward. I sigh.

“You know Liam wants to talk to you,” Alex says softly.

“Yeah.”

“Are you going to let him?”

I shrug. “I don’t want to talk about it.”

“I didn’t say he wants to talk about it,” Alex says. “I said he wants to talk *to* you, sis. There’s a difference.”

“Is there? I can’t imagine what else he would want to talk about.”

Alex sighs, and it somehow feels reproachful.

I don’t care. “I want a bath,” I tell him.

“Yeah. I think Davy’s working on that.”

“Good.” It actually sounds like the best news I’ve heard all month.

Eventually Davy and Peter head off, and Liam comes back toward Alex and me. As soon as he sits down, Alex gets up and leaves. Great.

“How’s your face?” Liam finally asks after several minutes.

“Fine. It hurts. But I’ll live.” It’s more than I can say for Lisette. I sigh.

“Is any of the blood on your clothes yours?”

I look down at myself. You can clearly see the rust colored splotches staining my clothes in the daylight. Damn.

“Not much.”

“Okay. Good. Are *you* okay?”

“I want a bath,” I say, not answering the question.

“Yeah. Okay,” Liam says with a hint of resignation as he reaches out and takes my hands in his.

I want to yank them away. I’m sure Lisette’s blood is still caked under my fingernails and around my cuticles. But I don’t. Instead I focus on locking down the nausea that’s coursing through me and drop my head to rest on my forearms. I am so damn tired. The realization catches me off guard. And there’s nothing I can do about it. Just like there’s nothing I can do about the blood that has long since dried hard and stiff across my clothes and skin.

“Did Davy say how long he was going to be gone?” I ask suddenly.

“No,” Liam says.

I want to scream.

“Hey, Hazel!” I hear Alex call.

“What?” I grate out.

“You good?”

“No. No, I am not fucking good. I need damned bath.”

“Here,” Henry says, digging through his pack and pulling out clothes that are cleaner than the ones I’m wearing.

He hands them to Alex who brings them to me. I’m already stripping off everything I’m wearing before Alex is halfway between us. I yank on Henry’s clothes as Alex hands them to me, and I feel marginally better now that I’m not sitting in clothes caked with Lisette’s blood.

“Thanks,” I manage, and I see Henry nod.

“Better?” Alex asks, clearly concerned.

I nod, “A bit, yeah.”

“Okay. I know it sucks, but I need you to sit here, be still, and keep your shit together, Hazel,” he tells me.

“I know,” I say quietly.

“Liam, talk *to* her,” Alex says. “Tell her about… I don’t know. Your first kiss,” Alex says waving distractedly.

“Oh,” Gavin says. “Lucy Davis.”

“Shut up, Gavin,” Liam tells him.

“No, this is good,” Alex interjects. “Keep talking, Gavin.”

Gavin smirks as he makes his way toward us. “You were what? Fifteen?” Gavin asks waiting for Liam to respond, but Liam just sighs, so Gavin continues. “Anyway, she was a neighborhood girl that lived near him, and he’d had a crush on her since he came to Branton. For four years he mooned over Lucy Davis.

“Lucy Davis, who was a bit of a… How would you describe her, Giorgi?”

“Bitch,” Giorgi supplies succinctly.

“Yeah. That. But it didn’t matter. Liam was *completely* infatuated with her. Anyway, he walks her home one evening, and they get to the top of the steps in front of her door, and Liam finally decides to make a move, and kiss her. When he does, she shoves him, and he goes flying down the steps and cracks his head on the flagstones below. Giorgi and I had to carry him home, blood pouring from the back of his head.

“When we got back, his grandma assumed it was our fault, that we’d done something that ended up getting him hurt, and he had to explain that it wasn’t us, it was *Lucy*, which of course meant he had to explain the details because she wasn’t just going to leave it alone at that,” Gavin says laughing.

“Tell her the rest,” Giorgi says.

“Please don’t,” Liam contradicts.

Gavin looks between Liam and Giorgi for a moment, when Giorgi repeats, “Tell her.”

“The next day,” Gavin says, evidently having decided to listen to Giorgi, “Liam, being Liam, goes around to apologize to Lucy. And Lucy not only tells him that she’s not interested in him, but that she was never interested in him, and was only hanging around Liam because it meant she got to hang around us.”

“Around Gavin,” Giorgi clarifies.

“Ah,” I say at the same time, I hear Alex mutter, “Ouch,” from a few feet away.

“Thanks,” Liam says, clearly annoyed. “Definitely appreciate reliving that.”

“Hazel, are you feeling better or worse than you were ten minutes ago?” Alex asks.

“Better,” I admit.

“Fine,” Liam grumbles as Alex stares at him.

“First kisses are never good,” I tell Liam.

“Not usually that bad though,” Giorgi remarks, continuing to rib Liam.

About an hour later Peter comes back without Davy. Somehow, Davy managed to get rooms at an inn a couple of miles away. Peter takes us there. I’m not sure where Davy has gone. Alex has been talking to Peter so he probably knows.

Eventually, Alex comes and talks to Liam. I ignore them both. Unless they’re discussing the logistics of baths, I don’t care. And the logistics of baths are that I get a bath, and if there’s a limited number of baths to be had, I get a bath *first*. I don’t think anyone will argue with me. Once again, the thought has me wanting to burst out laughing, and once again, I suppress the urge because I’m pretty sure there are rules somewhere. And the rules probably state that there’s at least a twenty four hour moratorium on laughter after your hands have been covered in someone else’s blood.

The next time I focus on my surroundings instead of my internal dialog, we’re walking up a staircase. Alex and Liam are still talking. Or talking again? Who knows.

A door opens, and Liam’s hand is on my back, pushing me through it. Mercifully, there’s a tub full of water already in the room.

“Davy had them bring the water,” Liam tells me after the door shuts as I’m stripping off my clothes and stepping into it.

The water is only slightly warmer than room temperature, but I don’t care.

“Davy will be back soon with new clothes, and Alex is going to bring some food.”

“Okay,” I say and then I sink below water.

I count to a hundred. I consider the merits of trying for another hundred before coming up for air, but that would probably be stupid. The water runs down my face stinging the cut my cheek as I break the surface and take a breath.

What a fucking disaster.

I must have said it out loud because Liam is saying, “Yeah, it’s not great.”

“Shit. She was your friend,” I mutter. Liam’s friend, and Henry’s. Gavin’s, Giorgi’s… She was everyone’s friend.

“She was your friend too,” Liam says as I sink back beneath the water and finally let out the scream I’ve been repressing for the last several hours.

I begin the process of incorporating this new knowledge into what I know about myself, and it is not going well for me. Liam finally reaches into the tub and pulls me up. Apparently he was counting too.

“For what it’s worth,” he says, “you made the least bad decision.”

I nod because I know it’s true. I’ve known it was true for days, and somehow I like it even less now than I did three days ago.

“Alex brought food. Get out of the tub and eat something,” Liam tells me, handing me a towel.

Halfway through eating what Liam has handed me, a knock comes on the door. Liam gets up and answers it. He talks for a minute, takes something and closes the door.

“Here, new clothes.”

Once I’ve finished eating and have dressed, Liam opens the door again. Davy comes in.

“Davy’s going to hang out here with you while I go get cleaned up,” Liam says.

I roll my eyes. “I’m fine.”

“I know, but Davy wants to talk to you.”

“Whatever,” I huff. “You should keep the beard,” I tell Liam as he walks out the door.

“Thanks for the bath. And the clothes,” I say to Davy once the door has latched shut.

He nods. “You could have let Lisette get to Giorgi or me.”

“I know, but she was my mess.”

“She was as much my mess as yours,” Davy says.

“Maybe,” I shrug. “Maybe not.”

“You were right,” Davy says.

“About what?”

“They’re looking for us.”

“Yeah, I know.”

“How?”

“It’s the most logical course of action. It’s what I would do,” I shrug.

“Okay,” Davy stands. “Be nice to Liam,” he tells me as he moves to the door. “He’s worried about you.”

“When am I ever not nice to Liam?”

Davy laughs.

“Piss off, Davy,” I tell him as he leaves the room.
