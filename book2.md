# If We Don’t All Die

## Part 1

### 1 - Blue Monday

It’s two days after the dinner party where I didn’t kill my mother. Two miserable days. It seems like everyone else is falling in line. My mother says, *‘Jump!’* and they’re quick to ask, *‘How high?’*

It’s a new order.

Then there’s me. I feel like I’m being suffocated. Like I can’t breathe. I look around, and it seems like everyone else is fine. Even Alex seems *fine*. And I can’t understand it. How are they okay with this? How are they okay with letting Liam’s life be used as collateral for her own? With allowing her to force us all to take her back to Branton? With her decision to become involved in the Allied Polities politics?

As if there’s any surer way to start a war than to let her rule Avonare.

I’ve been spending a lot of time alone on the roof, thinking. Weighing my options. Considering things. Endeavoring to act instead of react, because Peter was right about that, as much as I hate to admit it.

Liam has tried more than once to convince me to come inside. Alex and Davy have both been up here to do the same. Gavin was up here a few hours ago.

Giorgi is here now.

Unlike the others, he’s been quiet. Hasn’t so much as said hello. Just nodded and sat down a few feet away about an hour ago.

The way I see it, she can kill Liam exactly once, and the second she does, she’s dead, and she knows it. Which means she can’t kill him at all. She thinks he’s leverage, and he is. Kind of. But he’s piss poor leverage. She’s not nearly so clever as she thinks she is.

I sigh. “What’s your take on all this?” I ask Giorgi, finally breaking my silence.

He leans back on his palms and shakes his blond hair out of his face. I can see him considering his words for a long moment before he finally says, “I don’t think she can see the future.”

“Fucking thank you!” I burst out with more than a hint of relief. I’m so glad to hear someone else say the same thing. “Why?” I ask him. I know all the reasons I don’t believe her, but I want to hear his.

He shrugs. “She’s too nervous. All the time.”

“What do you mean?”

“She’s nervous in the same way you’re restless,” he elaborates after several moments. “It’s practically a character trait.”

“Huh. I never noticed.”

“Her left hand,” he states. “She has a habit of running her thumb across the pad of her middle finger. It’s small and you have to be looking for it, but it’s there.”

“You’re sure it’s nervousness?”

“Pretty sure.”

“Thanks. That helps.”

He nods.

----

It’s late afternoon when I finally go back inside, and the sun slants through the windows in a yellow so deep it borders on amber. I want to talk to Liam before I talk to anyone else. He’ll be thrilled I’m not on the roof. I check the room we’ve been sharing—the room I refuse to refer to as mine—first, but he’s not there. I check the room Davy and Alex have been occupying next, but it’s empty as well.

I let my magic stretch out, trying to find everyone. The house is empty. There’s no one here except for me. I let it unfurl and reach further into the distance, searching for people. I feel everyone outside somewhere, off to the southwest and I go looking. I’m not about to stay in this house alone for even a second.

I have to walk about a mile through the woods to get to them. It’s winter in Leisch, but we’re so close to the ocean that winters here are mild enough the forest is still tinged in green, just nowhere near the riot of growth it will be in the summer. Based on where it feels like they are, I wend my way down a small trail which is barely bigger than a game trail. I don’t remember this being here, but that was years ago.

The trail abruptly opens into a small clearing. Unfortunately, when it does, I realize they really are *all* in the woods. My mother included.

“Good. You’ve decided to join us, daughter,” she remarks with more than a hint of ice in her tone.

I manage to refrain from correcting her as I take up a position between Liam and Alex.

“I think Hazel has mentioned she prefers to be called by her name, Alexandria,” Peter tells her.

I find myself an odd mixture of surprised, confused, and grateful—surprised that anyone else bothered to say something, confused it was Peter, and grateful that it was someone other than me, since she clearly doesn’t listen to, or care, what I have to say.

She says nothing in response, and only levels a cold, appraising look at Peter.

I watch her left hand, and notice Giorgi is right. She is ever so slightly rubbing the nail of her thumb across the tip of her middle finger. Interesting.

She continues staring Peter down, but he doesn’t look away. He mildly matches her stare, but manages to do so without a hint of malice or irritation showing in his blue eyes. I wonder if I can learn to do that. Probably not.

“Hmm,” she finally says, before looking away first.

*What the hell just happened?* I wonder.

“Children,” she begins, and I hear Gavin smothering a laugh, which quickly spreads to the rest of us and suddenly, as we all stand there laughing, I feel better than I have in days. Weeks even. Maybe since we left Branton.

A loud crack echoes through the clearing, and my mirth vanishes as quickly as it appeared. I look over and see a red handprint darkening Gavin’s left cheek. Before I can think better of it, I’m moving toward her. I grab her right shoulder and spin her toward me at the same time I shove, throwing her off balance enough so that she takes a step back, and trips over the foot I’ve planted in her path, sending her sprawling onto her back. I follow her down onto the ground, driving a knee into her stomach, and placing my forearm across her throat. I note that her eyes have widened in shock or fear. I’m not sure which, and I don’t particularly care.

“You do *not* get to hurt my friends,” I tell her flatly, before slowly withdrawing my arm. “If you want to teach them, and they agree, fine.”

“I’ll do what I like, daughter. Or did you forget about Liam?”

“No, I didn’t forget about Liam. And no, you will *not* do what you like. You can kill Liam exactly once. Then you know what will happen. So you *will* stop with the idle threats toward Liam, and you will not hurt my friends. If you want allies,” I continue, “then you will treat us like allies. Do you understand?”

She says nothing, which I take as assent, and I return to my spot between Liam and Alex.

Alex throws an arm around my shoulders, helping to mitigate the adrenaline coursing through my body a bit, but I still feel shaky. This is not how I planned on this going, and I’m not sure what the fallout is going to be.

I cast a sideways glance at Liam, hoping he’s not too upset by the fact that I basically told my mother to ‘try me’ when his life is what’s at stake. This is why I was hoping to talk to him alone first. I knew we would get to this point, and I knew it wouldn’t take long. I was just hoping it would take a little bit longer than this. But I’m done letting her be… her. It’s like I said, if she wants allies then we deserve to be treated as such.

It *is* a new fucking order. For everyone.

Thankfully, Liam looks unperturbed and reaches out to take my hand when he notices me glancing at him, which makes me feel a lot better about my decision not to let her run roughshod over us all.

My mother regains her feet, and continues on as if nothing happened. “Today you will all be learning magic.”

I sigh. I’d feel better if I had any idea what she was planning, but I guess there’s no time like the present to find out.

----

My mother concludes her class—if you can call it that—after a couple of hours and I think everyone is left frustrated by it. She spent a solid twenty minutes babbling on about esoteric energy meridians, then had them spend another twenty minutes visualizing the energy flowing along their meridians, *‘up and down, and up and down.’* I’m not kidding. She must have said ‘up and down’ at least two hundred times. Then she had them spend an hour and a half trying to push some rocks across the ground by projecting their energy meridians outward. It’s like she was trying to make everything as confusing as possible.

“Did any of that make sense to anyone?” Henry finally asks after my mother has left.

“No,” Giorgi answers and everyone else nods in agreement with him.

“Wanting something and letting yourself have it makes a lot more sense,” Gavin says.

Henry nods, agreeing with Gavin, but Lisette says, “None of it makes any sense!”

Out of everyone, she’s the most frustrated. She was the one who asked if I could teach her and she still hasn’t figured out how to untie the knot. Gavin and Henry both have. I’m not sure if Giorgi’s even bothered trying.

“Fine,” I sigh. “Lisette. Come sit,” I tell her as I take a seat cross legged on the ground. “Liam, can you watch too?”

He nods and takes a seat next to me as Lisette sits across from me.

“Okay. Show me,” I tell her.

“Show you what? I can’t *do* anything!”

“Try to untie the knot. Even if nothing happens.”

I see a look of intense focus on her face, and I feel something, but it doesn’t exactly feel like she’s close. I look at Liam. “What do you think?”

“I don’t know,” he tells me. “I’ve only really paid attention to you, Alex, and Davy doing magic and I doubt that’s a valid comparison.”

“Gavin, can you untie the knot, please?”

He nods, and then does it with surprising quickness. Merely a couple of seconds.

Once he’s done, I ask the same of Henry. Henry’s not as fast as Gavin, but he’s under the ten seconds I mentioned that first day.

“Try again, Lisette.”

She wears the same look of concentration mixed with frustration as she did earlier while trying to unknot the fabric strip.

“So,” I say to Liam again, “what do you think?”

“I feel something, but it’s not what it felt like when Henry and Gavin did it.”

I nod. “It felt the same to me.” I’m not sure how to help. “Davy, any ideas?”

He shrugs. “She wanted to learn to make a fire. Try that.”

I’m not thrilled about it, but maybe it being the thing she wanted to learn will help. I have no idea. I know functionally nothing about teaching someone how to do magic. Magic is like breathing to me.

“Fine. Tomorrow we’ll try fire,” I tell them all. “Until then, Lisette, keep trying the knot, and I don’t know. I guess the shit with the energy meridians or whatever. It sounds ridiculous to me, but who knows.

“Giorgi, are you getting in on this?” I ask.

He shrugs, but says, “Sure.”

“Can you do the knot?”

“I haven’t tried. I don’t care about unknotting some fabric, Hazel.”

I let out a long suffering sigh, but say, “Fine. Can you keep an eye on my mother? Earlier may have been a mistake.”

He nods and walks away back toward the house. Lisette, Gavin, and Henry trail after him.

“Hey, Peter,” I call out as he moves to leave too. “Thanks for earlier.”

A few minutes after Peter has left, I can’t help but ask, “Should I not have done that?”

“It was bound to happen sooner or later,” Alex says. “May as well have been now.”

“You set a boundary,” Davy shrugs. “Who knows what she’ll do next, but that would be true regardless of whether or not you’d done anything today,” he reminds me, which is true.

I nod. “We need to get back to Branton. Sooner rather than later. The sooner we get back, the sooner we can figure out how to undo what she’s done to Liam.”

“I know. I’m working on it,” Davy tells me, running a hand through his curls and making them stand on end. “We can’t do another overland trip. The pass will be even worse now. If we want to go in the next four months, we’re going to have to go by ship.”

“Fuck. Kill me now,” I groan. “That’s what? Six weeks at least?”

Davy nods. “Lucky we’re going south though. You can’t even sail the other direction this time of year.”

“We clearly have different definitions of ‘lucky,’” I tell him drily.

“What’s wrong with taking a ship?” Liam asks.

“I’m sorry, have you even *met* Hazel?” Alex questions him. “Is there any place more boring than a ship in the middle of the ocean? Even I’m going to be losing my mind after a couple of days.”

“By the end of the trip,” Davy tells Liam seriously, “you’re going to want to strangle both of them. They will be so desperately annoying you’ll want to spend at least a week avoiding them.”

I want to tell him to shut up, but I know he’s right. Right now, just the thought of having to be on a ship for that long is making my skin crawl and my mind bounce around frantically.

“I think I’d rather go back through the pass.”

“No,” Liam says with a look approaching horror on his face as he looks at me. “We’re not doing that again. Ever, I hope.”

“Okay,” I agree, because as bad as the pass was for me, I think it might have been worse for him. “I’m sorry I didn’t get the chance to talk to you first about calling her bluff. I was trying to find you so we could talk about it, but then, well. You know.”

He grins. “It was worth it. And who knows, maybe she’ll be less… Whatever she is.”

“I wouldn’t count on it.”

“Seconded,” Alex concurs.

“Let’s head back,” I tell the others. Dusk is quickly approaching the point of dark, and I can hear the faint hum of insects. “I need something to eat.”

“Are you done with the roof?” Liam asks.

“For now. Until the next time I feel like I’m suffocating,” I mutter. “How much longer until we can leave, Davy?”

“I’ll let you know tomorrow. I need to talk to the Vernes.”

“Do you think she’s actually friends with them?” I ask him, remembering what she said.

“No, but who knows. It turns out Alexandria is full of surprises,” Davy says.

“You’re not buying all the stuff about her being a seer, are you?”

“Anything is possible I guess, but it wouldn’t have been my first thought.”

“Giorgi thinks she’s full of shit,” I tell them all. “He says she’s too nervous all the time.”

“Huh,” Davy says.

“Yeah. He said to watch her left hand,” I shrug. “Alex, what’s your take?”

“I don’t know. She’s probably lying but… I don’t know.” He sighs. “I honestly have no clue.”

### 2 - That’s Not My Name

Early the next morning, I have Lisette, Gavin, Giorgi, and Henry standing knee deep in a broad shallow stream a few miles from the house. Fire’s not really any harder than anything else when it’s small and contained, but it’s a whole lot more dangerous and destructive than most things. Hence the stream. But it’s fucking cold this early in the morning.

“Well, if I wasn’t already awake, this would do it,” Gavin quips to Henry.

“I think my feet are going to go numb,” Lisette remarks.

“Think warm thoughts,” I tell her.

I distribute sheets of paper to everyone. Paper’s flammability point is low. It’s easy to burn. Easier than a stick. Or holding fire in your palm without anything for it to consume as it burns. That actually takes most people some practice.

“So, now you all have paper. Next thing to do is set it on fire,” I say, setting my own piece of paper ablaze.

“Okay, but how?” Gavin asks.

“Same as anything. You want it to be on fire, and then you let yourself have it.” When I see the same confused looks as always, I continue, “Have you ever used sunlight refracted off a piece of glass to set something on fire?”

Everyone nods.

“Well. The glass doesn’t ask how, it just does it. You’re the sunlight and the glass. Congratulations. Let’s see what you’ve got. Try not to set yourselves on fire.”

“We could do that?” Henry asks.

“Who knows? Maybe. Shit can go really wrong, really fast with magic.”

“What’s the most wrong it’s gone for you?” Gavin questions.

“I almost died on the way here. *Before* we got to the pass,” I tell him as I exit the stream and return to dry ground. I don’t bother explaining that if Liam hadn’t killed the deer, I’m not sure I would have been fast enough. None of them know about the deer. I’d like to keep it that way.

“You almost died on the way here? Before the pass?” Peter asks softly from where he’s observing on the stream bank as I near him. He’s the only other one who came today. “Was that the day Liam came riding back with you on his horse?”

“Yes.”

“What happened?”

“The magic went really wrong. Really fast,” I answer, giving him a flat look that clearly says I don’t want to talk about it. He earned himself back some goodwill yesterday, but not that much.

“Does Liam know you almost died?”

“He was there, wasn’t he?”

“Doesn’t mean he knows,” Peter tells me, and he’s not wrong, generally speaking.

“He knows.”

“Hmm.”

I don’t want to ask, but it’s going to drive me nuts if I don’t, so I finally give in and say, “‘Hmm’ what?”

“I’m surprised he wasn’t angrier, is all,” Peter comments, as he looks out at the others in the stream.

“He was plenty angry,” I tell Peter.

“Hmm. So, who do you think is going to get it first?”

“Giorgi.”

“Really? He hasn’t done anything at all yet. Not even the knot you gave the others.”

I shrug.

Ten minutes later, Giorgi’s paper is on fire. I look at Peter and raise my eyebrows. Then I wade back into the stream and give Giorgi two pieces of paper rolled into cones. “Figure out how to light them both at the same time,” I tell him and walk back to the shore.

“How did you know?” Peter asks me, curiosity shining in his blue eyes.

“Giorgi understands wanting something and letting yourself have it. He gets the idea of imposing your will on the world with the expectation that it will obey. You can look at him and practically see it,” I say softly. “He’s not… warm and fuzzy the way most people are. He’s a lot more like me than anyone else here is.”

Giorgi could torture a few thousand animals to death in pursuit of a goal if he needed to. Like me, I don’t think he’d enjoy it, but he could do it. I sigh.

Giorgi figures out how to do two at once before anyone else figures out one. I roll ten more pieces of paper into cones and stick them in the sand spaced at intervals of about a foot.

“All ten. At the same time,” I say.

Giorgi nods, his golden hair catching the sunlight, and I return to stand next to Peter.

“Do you think you could do that?” I ask him. I’m not sure what Peter’s skills are like, beyond being really good at fucking with people’s memories.

“Maybe,” he tells me. “Probably.”

I stick ten more rolled pieces of paper into the sand. “Do you think you can do it before Giorgi?” I ask in challenge.

He sighs, but turns his focus to the paper cones.

In a few minutes, Peter has all ten pieces of paper alight.

“Not bad,” I tell him. “A bit slow. You could definitely use some practice. But not bad.”

“Thanks for the most tepid compliment I’ve ever heard, Hazel,” Peter says sarcastically.

“Get faster and the compliments might get better,” I tell him without hesitation.

Another five minutes pass before Giorgi manages to get his paper cones lit. But he does, and all at the same time too.

“Nice. Come out of the stream.” I wait for him to near Peter and me, and then tell him, “You’re actually pretty good at this. Good enough to fuck it up spectacularly, so do me a favor and don’t practice this shit alone, yeah?”

He nods in assent, then says quietly, “You know your mom’s been watching for the last twenty minutes?”

“Fuck,” I groan out. “You couldn’t have mentioned that twenty minutes ago?”

“I was a bit busy then,” he tells me with a shrug.

“Where is she?” I ask him.

“About sixty feet diagonally over your left shoulder.”

“And she’s just been watching?”

He nods.

“Okay. Thanks.”

Giorgi stands next to Peter and me as we watch the others. “Henry will be next,” I tell them both.

Sure enough, about ten minutes later, Henry manages to light his paper. I wade back in and hand him two paper cones, and give him the same instructions I gave Giorgi.

I sigh. “I’m probably going to regret this,” I mutter. Then I turn and pitch my voice loudly enough to carry. “Would you like to come join us?” I ask my mother. I want to sarcastically add on, *and offer your vast expertise,* but I restrain myself from being a total dick.

She takes a moment to think about it, I guess, and then walks over to us. She stands on the far side, keeping Giorgi and Peter between us.

“So. Any thoughts?” I ask when she’s quiet for several minutes.

“Wanting something and letting yourself have it might work for the others, but it’s not going to work for the blond,” she says finally.

“Lisette,” I remind her, because people do have names. “Okay.” I pause, but she doesn’t say anything else. “Then what do you think will?”

“What I was teaching them yesterday.”

“Seriously? You weren’t just screwing with them?”

“No, daughter, I was not ‘just screwing with them,’” she says in a fair imitation of me.

“Hazel,” Peter and I both tell her at the same time.

“My name is Hazel. Her name is Lisette. This is Peter,” I say as I point to him. “And that’s Giorgi. Gavin is in the river. As is Henry. Henry is the one holding two pieces of paper. *We all have names.*”

She sighs. Loudly.

Moments later, Gavin successfully sets his paper aflame. I wade back in and give Gavin two pieces of paper, the same as the others. Lisette is still struggling though, and even I have to admit my mother is right. This isn’t working for her.

When I return to dry land, my mother continues, “*You* never had to learn about moving energy around because you’re able to innately do it, without thinking about it, without even realizing you’re doing it. She, clearly, cannot.”

“Fine, so go help her, then,” I say irritatedly.

She snorts in what might be amusement. “And wade into the creek? I think not. She, and the others, can show up to my class this afternoon. We can both teach them,” she says nodding as if the decision has been made and everyone has agreed to it.

I successfully fight to keep from rolling my eyes.

----

When I return to the house, I find Liam with Alex and Davy out on the grounds near the topiary bear. I think my mother maintains the topiary zoo herself. It’s weird. Everything about this place is weird.

“What are you guys up to?” I ask.

“Planning. That thing you’re terrible at,” Alex tells me.

“Planning…?”

“We’ll talk about it later.”

“Fine. Well. Giorgi.” I pause, trying to decide what to say.

“What about Giorgi?” Liam asks.

“We have a lot in common.”

“What do you mean?”

Again, I debate how to answer this. “He’s potentially really powerful. More so than any of the others. Not exactly… I don’t know. I’m guessing he doesn’t feel guilty about anything ever, either. And once he’s made a decision, the ends justify the means regardless of what the means are. Could be useful,” I say with a shrug.

“How’d it go with Lisette?” Davy asks.

“Same as before. Alexandria says she needs to learn about energy meridians or whatever.”

“She was there this morning? *That* is interesting.”

“Yeah, according to Giorgi she showed up about twenty minutes into it. Stood watching in the distance for a while before I invited her over,” I tell Davy.

“*You* invited her over?” Alex asks, as if he thinks he misheard me.

“Yeah. Lisette,” I explain with a disgruntled sigh, “I don’t know what to do about her, and it’s possible our mother may know more about teaching magic to people than I do, since I know absolutely nothing.”

“I wouldn’t count on it,” Davy says. “I think she might have gotten lucky with the three of us.”

“Maybe. Did she ever mention energy meridians to either of you before yesterday?” I ask Davy and Alex.

“No,” they both answer.

“That’s what I thought. I said as much to her this morning when she said Lisette needed to learn how to move energy around. She told me she never had to teach me because I intrinsically knew how to do it, and Lisette doesn’t. I’m not sure if she’s full of shit or not.

“Anyway, she wants us both to teach them. She’s apparently holding her class this afternoon, back in the clearing. She has requested we all attend.”

“I won’t be able to make it,” Davy tells me quickly.

“What are you doing?”

“Talking to the Vernes. Getting us a ship.”

“I’m coming too,” I tell him. “I want to meet them. Alex, can you make sure she doesn’t kill everyone while we’re gone?”

“Sure, sure. I’ll babysit mom. I have more experience with it than you guys anyway. But you’ll owe me.”

“Owe you what?”

“I’ll let you know when I know.”

I sigh, but don’t object. “Where are you meeting the Vernes?

“Lusigan,” Davy answers.

Of course. Where else would you meet the ruling family of the polity except for the capital of the polity. Fucking politics.

“That’s what, thirty miles? Liam, you want to come? Might be useful to find out if whatever she did to you changes or weakens over distance. I’m guessing it won’t, but it’d be good to verify. Plus, it’ll give us a chance to try to teach you how to feed energy into your horse.”

“I’ll come, but I don’t know if I can do that,” Liam says.

“Good. And likewise. That’s why we’re going to try to teach you.”

He nods.

### 3 - Heathens

An hour and a half later, Liam, Davy, and I are standing in the stables.

“I figure we’ll try this here, before we leave,” I tell Liam. “It’s similar to the rings, but instead of heat, it’s only energy. We’ll have you try it with Davy first since the way your magic interacts with mine seems… volatile.”

Davy sighs and holds up his hand. I know he’s not keen about being a guinea pig, but between the two of us, he’s the safer option.

“And I just… push the energy into Davy?”

“Think of it less as a push and more of drip or a trickle,” I answer.

“Can I see one of you guys do it first? I think it might help.”

I look at Davy and he shrugs. “Okay,” I say as I place my hand against Davy’s, and he starts trickling energy into me. I’ve never actually had anyone do this to me before, and it feels so weird. It’s like my hand is vibrating from the inside out. It doesn’t hurt, but the sensation isn’t exactly pleasant. Still, I stay there for a few seconds before pulling my hand back.

“Got it?” I ask Liam.

He nods, and puts his hand up to Davy’s. Almost immediately, Davy yanks his hand back with a hiss.

“Less,” Davy says, and extends his hand back to Liam’s. After a moment, he says, “That’s better.”

“So this energy,” I explain, “it’s coming from you. But you’re not going to want to use your own energy for a thirty mile horse ride. This is where pulling energy from the heat in the air is useful. You’ve seen me do it before, yeah?”

“Yeah, but it doesn’t mean I can do it,” Liam says skeptically.

“Try.”

“Show me again,” Liam says. “I’ve never watched you do it with the intention of trying to replicate it.”

“Davy will show you. He’s probably better to use as an example anyway.”

After a few seconds I feel the air begin to cool, and then it stops, and stabilizes. It kind of feels like clouds rolling in front of the sun on a sunny day.

“Good?” Davy asks Liam.

Liam nods, and I say, “Okay, now take the energy out of the air and let it trickle into Davy. Slowly. Very slowly. Just like before.”

They each put their hands back up and the air cools a little bit more, but Davy doesn’t yank his hand away like he did the first time. After a few seconds they drop their hands.

“That’s… I’m supposed to do that for thirty miles?” Liam asks incredulously.

I shrug. “Do it for however long you think you can, and then I’ll pick it up after that. It gets easier the more you do it. Eventually, you should be able to do it without thinking. Okay. Let’s go,” I say as I lead my horse out.

----

Liam lasts about eight miles—or a bit less than twenty minutes, since we’re moving pretty quickly—before I see the exhaustion start to creep in, and I take over managing his horse’s energy for him.

Within the next hour, we’re entering Lusigan. Davy immediately takes us to a large house near the center of the city, and we hand our horses off to the help that comes rushing out from the house’s stables. Davy quickly approaches the door and knocks while Liam and I trail behind.

I have no idea whose house this is, though I’m guessing Liam knows.

The door is opened by a middle-aged woman. “Davy Iverson, to see Amelia Price,” he announces to her.

“Guess we’re not hiding anymore,” I mutter.

“At this point,” Davy says over his shoulder, “it doesn’t seem like there’s much reason to. It’s all coming out, so we may as well use it to our advantage as much as we can.”

The entire concept makes me nauseous. Liam, noting my discomfort, takes my hand in his and squeezes it slightly. I move a little bit closer to him, and try not to dread a future that hasn’t yet happened too much.

A few moments later, Amelia appears at the door and invites us inside.

“Glad to see you made it back okay,” I tell her as we walk in. I don’t really care. In all honesty, I’ve barely thought about her since well before we left the pass, but it seems like one of those things you’re supposed to say.

“Thank you,” she responds, equanimously.

I begin looking around as she leads us to some sort of sitting room, already growing bored. As we sit down, I see Amelia notice and smirk, her green eyes glinting.

“What can I do for you, Davy?” she asks. “I know coming here wasn’t Hazel’s idea. She already looks ready to leave.”

“Whatever,” I grumble.

Liam chuckles.

“Shut up,” I say, elbowing him lightly in the ribs.

Davy rolls his eyes. “We would like a meeting with the polity’s leaders. We need to get back to Branton and we need a ship. Seeing as they’ve been harboring and helping Alexandria Raidane, they seem in a likely position to help.”

Amelia nods as if she expected this, and perhaps she did. I don’t know where else we’d get a ship, short of commandeering one.

“Okay. Let’s go,” she tells us.

“Now?” I ask.

“Unless you’ve got somewhere else to be?”

“Nope, simply surprised we’re not waiting around forever.”

“It’s my uncle and grandparents. They’ll make time,” she says with certainty.

“Huh,” I say.

“What?”

“Nothing,” I answer quickly. “I just, uh… Never mind.”

“What? Say it.”

“Hazel and I don’t have family like that,” Davy tells her.

“Oh.”

----

Twenty minutes later, we’re sitting in a government building. And true to Amelia’s statement, less than fifteen minutes after our arrival, two men with a definite family resemblance are walking into the room. The older man appears to be in his late sixties or early seventies, and the younger looks to be in his late forties. They both share the same tall, thin body type, and I imagine at one point they both had the same hair color as well, though the older man’s is now solidly grey, while the younger’s is a darker auburn than Amelia’s but streaked through with grey.

Amelia stands as they enter, and Liam, Davy, and I join her.

She begins introductions. “This is my uncle, John Verne,” she tells us, gesturing to the younger of the two men, “and my grandfather Robert,” she says, indicating the older man. She pauses to allow us to introduce ourselves.

“Davy Iverson,” Davy says, extending a hand, which they both shake.

“Iverson?” Robert asks with a sharp look.

“Christine Iverson is my mother,” Davy supplies emotionlessly.

Their eyes turn to me. I suck it up and say, “Hazel Raidane,” as I extend my own hand.

“Yes. The family resemblance is quite dramatic,” Robert says, shaking my hand.

“Hazel saved my life while we were crossing the pass,” Amelia tells her family. “Twice.”

Their eyes are somewhat more appraising as they turn back to me. “Your mother is very powerful,” John comments as he takes my hand.

“Yes,” I say in agreement. My mother and John appear to be a similar age. I wonder how well they know one another.

Finally they shift their eyes to Liam.

“Liam Marten,” he tells them, extending his hand. “Captain of the Guard of the Branton War College.”

*Well, one of us clearly understands how this game is played*, I think as I side eye him.

“Yes, I believe Amelia has mentioned you,” John says, as he takes his hand.

Liam nods and we all sit back down.

“So why are you all here?” Robert asks without preamble.

“We need to return to Branton, sooner rather than later, and will need a ship to do so,” Davy responds equally to the point.

I find myself liking this conversation more and more by the second.

“And we would be inclined to provide you with a ship because…?” John asks

“Well,” I interject, “according to my mother, your family is good friends with mine, and it is imperative to her that she returns quickly.” I’m interested to see what his response will be.

I can practically feel Davy glaring at me, but he can shove it. One way or another, we’ll leave with what we need, and if I can do some fact checking in the process, more’s the better.

“What my cousin means to say,” Davy begins, and now I’m the one glaring.

“Cousin?” John quickly asks.

“Indeed,” Davy says, but does not elaborate further. “Anyway, what she means to say is that it is rather urgent, and we would greatly appreciate any assistance you could offer.”

That is definitely *not* what I mean to say, but I bite my tongue and don’t contradict him.

“It seems like Alexandria may have left some parts of the story out,” John murmurs and Robert inclines his head slightly.

“Yes, well, if it makes you feel any better, I only recently found out you were… on speaking terms with one another. I was not aware that any of the polities’ ruling families knew where she was, let alone were friends? Allies? Of hers. How would you describe it?” I ask leaning forward slightly.

Robert looks at me, and I swear he looks amused. “We have a mutual goal. A common enemy, if you will,” he responds. “We are allies, of a sort, I suppose.”

“Interesting,” I say softly. She was telling the truth. In a manner of speaking. “How long have you been ‘allies?’”

“Many years,” he says, waving a hand blithely. “Your father,” he says, and whatever reaction he sees on my face seems to confirm his suspicion, since he nods before continuing, “tends to have that effect on people.”

“So I’ve heard,” I say in agreement, digging my nails into the palm of my hand to distract myself from how much I dislike this conversation.

“I had always wanted to meet you,” he tells me. “We knew she had a daughter, but she would never allow any of us to meet you.”

“I bet.” I lean back on the couch. I got the information I came for. I’m no longer particularly interested in this conversation.

“Returning to the matter at hand,” Davy says, prodding the others back on track. “We need a ship. We aren’t prepared to cross the pass twice in the same season.”

“Yes, I’m surprised you survived the once,” Robert says.

Suddenly I’m interested again.

“You wouldn’t know anything about the avalanches?” I say as I study his face.

“I know they happened,” he answers, “but no more than that. Though I can make an educated guess.”

“Can’t we all,” I mutter.

“And it seems everyone’s survival was primarily thanks to you and Davy?” Robert asks me, evidently having taken a liking to me.

“So it would seem,” I answer in the same blithe tone he used earlier.

“Mmm,” he grunts before also leaning back in his chair.

Apparently we’ve both gotten what we wanted out of this conversation.

Davy sighs in irritation before trying again, “If we could discuss the use of a ship, that would be *wonderful*.”

“Yes,” John agrees, “It’s like herding cats. I know the feeling well,” he says as he flicks a glance toward his father. “We will loan you a ship. On the condition you allow Amelia and her cousin, my son, Michael to travel with you.”

“Could be dangerous,” I tell them. “They both might die. Ships in the winter sea are notoriously dangerous under the best conditions,” I say hoping to discourage them. I don’t even really trust Amelia. The last thing I want is some cousin of hers I haven’t even met joining us. What I want is to say no.

“Amelia needs to go back anyway,” Liam says. They’re the first words he’s spoken since the introductions.

“Yes,” John agrees.

“Why do you want Michael to come?” I ask. “Shouldn’t you keep him here? Safe?”

John sighs, and rubs a hand over his face. “Your mother told my parents decades ago that there would come a time where they wouldn’t be able to sit this out. It appears that she was, unfortunately, right.”

“In Firgasu, we repressed and discouraged the use of magic more stringently than in any other polity,” Robert says.

“I’m aware.”

There have been many deaths in Firgasu over the years—mostly hangings, but some burnings too. And while some of those who were executed may have deserved it, many more were probably like me. Simply minding their own business until someone caught on to what they were, then along came the people with the pitchforks and malusium.

Only the people with the pitchforks are usually someone the target trusts, so that they can offer the victim a cup of water laced with malusium, rendering the accused magic user powerless and unable to save themself from their impending execution.

“We hoped by doing so, we could create a better, more fair society. And maybe if the ruling families of the other polities had acted similarly, or maybe if they were all like you and your mother, that would have worked. But they didn’t, and they’re not, and we’ve hamstrung ourselves.”

*Like me and my mother?* I want to ask, because it seems like we know very different people. But I don’t. It just goes to show they have absolutely no idea what they’re talking about. Davy should be proud of my restraint.

Instead I say, “What, exactly, are you asking for?”

“They need to be taught magic. Both of them. And there’s no one here qualified to do it.”

The hypocrisy of this request is ridiculous. The Vernes have rigorously enforced the execution of Firgasu’s citizens for using magic for longer than I’ve been alive. They’ve been perfectly okay with killing off their own people right up until the moment they see the need for magic, and now they suddenly want to learn how to do it. Fuck them all.

“Do you understand that you are asking for my mother to torture your grandchildren?” I ask to be clear.

Robert looks at Davy, and Davy nods. “Whatever you think you know about Alexandria and her methods, I can guarantee you are missing large chunks of information. Alexandria is as likely to kill your grandchildren as she is to send them back to you as functional magic users. She would not regret their loss should she kill them.”

“You survived,” Amelia notes.

I look her in the eyes hard. “I regularly have nightmares about my childhood. The kind of nightmares where you wake up unable to breathe. The kind of nightmares you have to spend all day shaking off. I have panic attacks all the time.”

I see her swallow.

“It’s possible she decides to stab you to test out whether or not you can heal the damage fast enough. Or worse, she stabs your cousin to see if you’re good enough to keep him alive.”

My eyes dart to Davy, and he lifts his shirt, displaying a two inch scar near his right kidney.

“That’s what you’re asking for,” I tell Robert and John, but mostly Amelia.

“And yet you survived,” Robert says, echoing Amelia’s earlier statement.

“Whatever. Fine. Send your children to the slaughter. I take no responsibility for them though,” I tell him.

He raises his eyebrows. “I wouldn’t expect you to.”

“Good.” I fall back onto the couch, having risen to my feet at some point.

I already made some stupid claim of responsibility to eight others, which I still don’t even fully understand.

Davy looks at Amelia. “You’re sure?”

“Yes.”

Davy and I both sigh loudly, in unison.

“Fine,” he also agrees.

### 4 - Outta Me, Onto You

We arrive back in Leisch late in the evening, and the house appears dark.

“Let’s take a walk,” Liam says after we stable the horses. He takes my hand, pulling me away from the house, as Davy heads towards it.

“Where are we going?” I ask after a few minutes.

“Nowhere. We’re just walking. I know you don’t like being in that house.”

“How do you think today went?”

“Fine. Robert liked you. Somehow they both seem to like your mother,” he sounds as confused about it as I am.

“Yeah. Well, I’m sure she can probably be charming if she puts her mind to it. The better to lure you into her clutches, I guess. I don’t want another person coming with us,” I admit.

“I know.”

“What do you make of that, anyway?”

“They’re more scared of General Iverson than they are of your mother,” he says softly.

“I wish I knew if their assessment of my mother or of him is more wrong. I have a feeling I’m going to have to meet the man,” I mutter. I really don’t want to. “You’ve met him. What do you think?”

“I think my assessment of him is wholly incorrect,” Liam admits with a sigh. “He’s always seemed like what you would expect given the known facts. Cold and arrogant, but not an existential threat. I haven’t spent much time around him though.

“How are you dealing with all of this?” he asks me.

“I should be the one asking you that question,” I answer. “Davy drugs you, then knocks you out and ties you to a horse, then my mother abducts you, and uses you as leverage to control me… I’m sorry. It’s a lot.”

“We can talk about me later,” he says, pulling me to a stop, and turning me to face him. The shadows cast by the moonlight make his blue-grey eyes appear infinitely dark and lend a silvery sheen to his hair, which has grown long enough to have a slight wave. “How are you doing?” he asks again.

“I’ve been better,” I finally answer, looking up into his eyes. “Being here… it feels like the walls are closing in on me. It’s not my favorite thing in the world. And tomorrow is going to suck.”

“Why?”

“Actions have consequences,” I tell him, with a sigh.

“What do you mean?”

“She wanted me at her ‘training,’ and I chose to go to Lusigan instead. There will be hell to pay, I’m sure.”

“You’re an adult, she doesn’t dictate where you go.”

I laugh, but there’s no amusement in it. “I’m not sure you’ve been paying attention.”

“I saw you take her to the ground yesterday, like it was nothing,” Liam tells me firmly.

“Yes, thereby demonstrating to her that actions have consequences. Tit for tat, Liam,” I say as I lean into him and wrap my arms around him.

“Amelia and Michael will arrive tomorrow, and then we’ll all be leaving to go back to Branton. We won’t be here much longer.”

I sigh. “Yeah, but it’s not really going to get better, is it? Six weeks aboard a ship, if we’re lucky. And then Branton. I can’t even think about Branton beyond possibly undoing whatever my mother did to you. Everything else is just… an impossible task. I can’t be who they all want me to be.”

“Who do you think they want you to be?”

“A deterrent. Failing that, a weapon. The one that makes General Iverson fall back in line. But what they’re asking is for me to become another version of him. But one that bows to their desires. I won’t be a tool for anyone, and I don’t want to rule anything.”

“Being your own person has gotten you this far,” Liam says and I feel his shoulders rise and fall in a shrug. “I think you can manage the next bit on your terms as well.”

“We’ll find out, I guess.” I tip my head back so I can see him. “Okay. Your turn. How are you dealing with all of this?”

“Your family is…”

“Insane?” I supply.

“A lot. I was going to say a lot, but insane works too. I can only imagine how much restraint it takes for you, since I find myself wanting to strangle your mother more and more with each passing day,” he says flatly, and I can’t help but laugh.

“I think you hide it a lot better than I do,” I inform him.

“We all hide it better than you,” he tells me, before kissing me. When we break apart he says, “I’m okay though. Let’s go back.”

I sigh, but I know he’s right. “Will you come tomorrow morning? When I’m ‘teaching’ the others? I want a second opinion on Lisette because I have no idea what I’m doing with any of this. I’m the last person who should be teaching anyone.”

“Yes. But for what it’s worth, I’m beginning to think no one knows how to teach this shit. I’m starting to think it’s either something you figure out, or you don’t.”

“Maybe,” I say.

“Maybe?” he questions.

I nod. “Maybe.”

“You think there’s another way,” he says with certainty.

“Maybe.”

“And you don’t want to talk about it?”

“Not really.”

“Okay.”

----

We’re back in the stream the next morning. Alex and Davy are the only ones who aren’t here. I think they’re probably informing my mother of yesterday’s happenings.

Gavin, Lisette, and Henry are still working on lighting the paper, but Henry and Gavin are further along than Lisette, working on lighting multiple pieces at the same time. Getting them started is easy because they’re all more or less doing the same thing as they were yesterday.

Based on how yesterday went, Giorgi’s working on something new. Peter has joined Giorgi in the river this morning. So apparently I’m teaching Peter now too. To say I have mixed feelings about it is an understatement, but here we are.

Liam is standing on the riverbank watching the first group. Really, I should have him practicing as well, but Lisette. Right now he’s probably more valuable watching her, because I’m pretty sure I know what’s going to happen this afternoon, and I’d rather it didn’t. I sigh, and turn my attention to Peter and Giorgi.

“So. Fire without a fuel source,” I say as I lift my hand, palm up, and make a globe of fire about six inches in diameter appear above it. “That’s what you’re working on today. Try not to burn yourselves.”

“Where are you getting the energy for that?” Peter asks.

“From the air.”

“Okay.”

I walk back to the bank and leave them to it.

“Lisette?” I ask Liam as I come to stand next to him.

“The same.”

“Damn.”

Liam wraps an arm around my waist and we stand there watching them.

I lean into him for a minute and then say, “You should go practice with Peter and Giorgi.”

“I’d rather stay here with you.”

“I know,” I say as I shove him slightly toward the stream.

Liam grumbles as he removes his boots and rolls up his pants before wading in. Between the three of them, my money’s on Giorgi figuring it out first. I’m going to have to talk to him later. But if it has to be someone, and I think it does, Giorgi’s a better choice than most.

About twenty minutes go by before Gavin is able to light both of his papers at the same time. So far, he’s slower than Henry to figure things out for the first time, but faster at refining them after that.

I set him the same task of ten at once that I gave Giorgi yesterday. About ten minutes after that, I’m doing the same for Henry. I expect it will keep them both busy for the remainder of the session. So far, there’s no change with Lisette.

Another twenty minutes go by and, as expected, Giorgi’s got a globe of fire hovering above his palm. It’s only a few inches in diameter though.

“Put it out,” I tell him. “Now do it again. Work on getting it the right size.”

He nods.

Ten minutes later he’s got it.

“Good. Keep practicing that for now.”

Peter and Liam get it at almost the same time, about fifteen minutes later, and I see them exchange a grin.

I have all three of them continue to practice it for a bit longer, before deciding it's enough for today.

As they leave the water I grab Lisette’s arm. “Before this afternoon,” I tell her, “I want you to think very hard about whether or not this is something you really want to be able to do.” I see the anger flash across her face, and continue, “You’ve made it this far without any magic. It’s not something you need. So think about it. That’s all.” I let go of her arm, and she walks away without saying anything.

“Giorgi, hold up a minute,” I call out. He pauses up ahead. When I catch up, Gavin, Peter, and Liam are all waiting with him. “You guys go ahead,” I tell them. “We’ll catch up.”

I stand there waiting until they start moving and are well out of earshot. “It might be useful for you to keep coming to these, but I think it would be more useful for you to meet me in the stables. Say around one?”

“Okay.”

“You know you’re not like the others?” I ask as we start walking back toward the house.

“I am, and I’m not.”

“Yeah. I know that feeling well.”

“I expect so,” he says.

We walk in silence until we catch up to Liam, Gavin, and Peter, who I have the impression were likely walking very slowly in hopes that we would.

“What was that all about?” Gavin asks.

I shrug.

“You know Giorgi will tell me later, so you may as well spill it,” Gavin says.

I look at Giorgi and he shrugs before saying, “If he asks. Yeah. Probably.”

“Fair. I told Giorgi he would benefit from meeting me in the stables later. He’ll probably learn faster without the rest of you slowing him down.”

“Ah,” Peter says.

“Shut the fuck up, Peter,” I say warningly.

“What?” Liam asks.

“Nothing,” I answer quickly.

“You tell him, or I will,” Peter says.

“Go ahead,” I say, calling what I hope is a bluff.

“Hazel wants to train Giorgi up in hopes that if she… what? Breaks bad one day, someone might have a chance at killing her,” Peter says.

Fuck.

Liam stops dead in his tracks. Fuck.

Gods damned Peter. I glare at him. “You and I will be having words later,” I tell him.

Giorgi looks between me and Liam. “So tomorrow, then?” he asks me.

I look at Liam and nod. “Tomorrow.”

Gavin, Giorgi, and Peter walk off. I close my eyes, take a deep breath, and brace myself.

“Anything to say?” Liam asks.

“Peter’s an asshole,” I state flatly.

“Peter?” Liam asks incredulously. “You think Peter’s the asshole here?”

Fuck.

“You’re unbelievable!” Liam shouts.

“It is a valid concern,” I state levelly.

“So instead of talking to me about it, you want to teach Giorgi how to kill you?” he’s still shouting.

“I didn’t bother talking to you about it because I knew this is how the conversation would go. And Giorgi’s the only viable option, because if it comes down to it, you won’t do it. Davy won’t do it. Alex won’t do it. But Giorgi would. I don’t know if he’ll be able to, but he would if he could.”

“Un-fucking-believable, Hazel!” Liam says, but he’s still standing there.

He hasn’t walked away yet, so I start talking. “Everyone wants the impossible from me, and maybe the impossible is the final nail in the coffin! I already feel like I’m pretending at being a person half the time. This, all of this, could be what makes it so that I don’t bother pretending at all, so excuse me for wanting a contingency plan!”

“This isn’t a contingency plan!”

“It’s the *only* contingency plan!” I say, stepping towards him, but he steps back in retreat. “Fine. You want to know how I feel? I feel defeated because every time I try to explain this part of myself to you, you act like I’m irrational. But I’m not. *This* is logical. It is a *rational* decision.”

“I asked you to talk to me last night!”

“I tried to!” I shout back. “And you told me to be my own person!”

“Because who you are is fine.”

“Who I am is fine, *for now!* Until you all push me too far and I can’t find my way back to being this person anymore!”

“Okay,” Liam says, taking a breath and running a hand through his hair to push it out of his face. He steps toward me and, unlike him, I hold my ground, so he takes another step. “Okay,” he repeats and wraps his arms around me.

I stay rigid within his embrace as he rests his chin on my head. “I hear what you’re saying, *but* I don’t think it’s a good plan. And I think you should have told me about it last night. You were already planning this last night, weren’t you?”

“Yes. I was planning it last night. And fine, you asked, and I probably should have mentioned it. But unless you have a better solution, I don’t want to listen to you tell me it’s a bad plan.” Okay. I guess I’m still angry.

“As a matter of fact, I do have a better solution.”

“Well?” I prompt.

“Be realistic. If it were ever to get to the point where Giorgi needed to kill you, it’s not like he’s going to be able to do it unless you let him which, at that point, you wouldn’t.”

“Yes. I am also aware of that, but I don’t see a better option.”

“Figure out what your mother did to me, and then do it to yourself,” he says, matter of factly.

Damn. It *is* a better solution. I finally relent and wrap my arms around him too.

“Fine. Your plan is better,” I admit. “But until then I want to teach Giorgi.”

“Fine,” he murmurs.

### 5 - D’You Know What I Mean?

A couple of hours later, we arrive back at the house. Liam sees Gavin and asks, “Do you know where Peter is?”

“Outside, by the weird lawn animals with Alex and Davy, I think. Why?” Gavin asks as Liam is already moving forward with his hand on the small of my back. “Oh, well. This looks fun. Count me in,” Gavin says.

I shoot him a look over my shoulder with my eyebrows raised in question, but he simply grins. We go through the house, out the rear door, and across the lawn to the topiary zoo.

Once we’re within twenty feet of the trio, I see Alex grab Davy’s arm and step back, at the same time Liam drops his hand from my back and continues striding forward alone toward Peter. Peter hears us behind him and begins turning toward us. As he completes the turn, Liam slams a hook into his ribs, and then nails him with a cross to his face that I’m pretty sure just broke his nose. And he’s already moving, grabbing Peter’s left arm, and yanking it around to force Peter to the ground face first. Once Peter’s on the ground, Liam puts a knee on his back pinning him there.

“Stay the fuck out of my relationship, Peter,” Liam tells him flatly. “Got it?”

“Yeah, got it,” Peter grunts in pain.

Liam releases his arm, and moves back to stand by me.

“I thought Peter *wasn’t* the asshole?” I say softly.

“No, he’s an asshole too,” Liam answers quickly.

Gavin laughs as Davy asks, “What the hell was that about?”

“Nothing Peter didn’t deserve,” Gavin informs him, merriment dancing in his brown eyes.

Peter regains his feet with a hand on his face, feeling his nose, as blood runs down his face and splatters onto his shirt. “I think you broke it,” Peter mumbles, glaring at Liam.

“Not for the first time, as I remember,” Gavin comments.

“Huh,” I say, giving Liam a sideways glance. He shrugs.

“See,” Gavin says to me with a smirk. “I told you Peter was just some neighborhood troublemaker we knew.”

I can’t help but laugh.

“Want me to fix it?” Alex asks Peter.

“No,” Liam tells Alex. “If he wants it fixed, he can figure out how to do it himself.”

Alex looks between them, and sighs. He steps back and leaves Peter to figure it out on his own.

It’s at this moment Henry comes out of the house with Amelia, and some guy I assume is her cousin, whatever his name was, trailing behind. When they finally come within speaking distance of our group, Amelia says, “That’s a good look on you, Peter,” as she laughs. “Did you do that, Hazel?”

“No,” I say, and look pointedly at Liam.

“Liam? Really? Interesting,” she comments. “I think I might actually prefer this version of you, Liam.”

Liam sighs irritatedly, but he brought this on himself as far as I’m concerned. Not that I wasn’t going to do something similar. But he kind of stole my thunder. And now if *I* punch Peter in the face, it looks like we’re unfairly ganging up on him.

Amelia’s cousin looks incredibly confused.

Finally, Amelia says, “Everyone, this is Michael. Michael, that’s Hazel, Liam, and Gavin,” she says pointing at us each in turn. “The idiot with the bloody face is Peter. The taller guy back there is Alex, and the shorter one is Davy. Alex is Hazel’s brother and Davy is her cousin. There are a couple of others around somewhere. Gavin’s younger brother Giorgi, and Lisette, who’s hard to miss.”

We all chorus some variation of ‘hi.’

“Henry, you know which rooms they’ll be staying in?” Davy asks.

“Yeah, I’ll show them,” Henry replies. “Come on, guys.”

“Make sure they make it to this afternoon’s training,” Davy calls after him. “You and I are going to have it coming,” Davy says, turning to me.

“I know,” I tell him. “She’s going to make it good too.”

“Yeah.”

----

We’re all back in the same clearing as a couple of days ago, waiting for her to show up. Davy and I have distanced ourselves from the others. There’s no reason to draw her attention to anyone else. So we stand alone, waiting for the axe to fall, as the others talk among themselves.

After about fifteen minutes, she finally walks into the clearing. “Oh good. Hazel and Davy have decided to join us today.”

“Shit,” I mutter and Davy nods in agreement. She used both of our names. Without prompting. She’s looking forward to whatever this is.

“They will be giving us a demonstration today,” she continues. “As they have clearly intuited.”

We both stand silently, waiting to hear whatever it is she’s devised, while the others look on with varying degrees of apprehension. Alex looks like a piano wire wound so tightly he might break at any moment, and I can see the concern etched across Liam’s face. The forced neutrality I see on Giorgi’s face tells me he also knows enough to know this is about to get ugly.

“Hazel and Davy are going to show us how to move energy through another’s meridians.” She turns to look directly at us. “You have three minutes to figure out how you want to do it.”

“Fine,” I answer. Turning my back slightly from the others. Davy follows suit as I shield the air around us to stop our conversation from traveling. “I’m pretty sure this is going to fucking hurt,” I tell Davy.

“Yup.”

“You should pull it through me,” I tell him. “I think I’m going to have to do this to Lisette, so it’d be better if I had some idea how it feels, anyway.”

“If I pull it through you, I’m not sure I’ll be able to shunt it off quickly enough,” he tells me.

“What if I try to slow the flow?”

“That’ll probably make it hurt worse,” he says, and I see the concern etched in the tightening of the skin around his dark brown eyes.

“I know. It’s fine. I’ll deal with it.”

“Okay.”

I start the process of separating my mind from my body as much as I can, because I have the feeling this is going to be really, really painful, and I’m just going to have to let it happen.

I drop the shield and turn back to my mother. “How long?”

“Until I say you’re done.”

Fuck. “Fine,” I say flatly. “Let’s go, Davy.” I hold my hand out, and he wraps his own around it.

“Ready?” he asks me.

I ensure there’s not too much power flowing through me and nod.

It’s the reverse of yesterday, and I’m merely a passive participant as Davy moves energy through me, and my body pulls in more to replace what he’s moving out of me, into himself, and then pushing back into our surroundings. It’s almost a perfect loop, but it hurts. A lot. It feels like I imagine having boiling liquid pumped through my veins would feel, and I move my mind further away from my body.

I’m uncertain how long it’s been—it feels like forever, but I don’t really know—when I hear the screaming start. I’m not sure who’s screaming. But someone. Not me, I think. I can’t deal with it though, because keeping the flow of power limited and the pain from overwhelming me is taking all of my focus.

*Davy*, I think I realize eventually. *It’s Davy screaming*, I’m not sure what’s gone wrong, but apparently something has. I’m trying to shut it down, but I can’t. It’s all flowing the wrong way.

I think I hear Alex and Liam shouting in the distance but I can’t make out the words. It’s all just angry sounds.

Then, with a jolt that feels like I’ve been kicked by a horse, I’m flat on my back and someone is grabbing me under my arms and pulling me upright. Giorgi, I realize. I look around for Davy, and see him on the ground with Alex hovering over him. I’m not sure how bad it is yet.

And Liam is holding a knife to my mother’s throat. “I’ll kill you myself,” he tells her, “if you ever pull another stunt like that. Right now, you are alive at my sufferance. Do not try me, Alexandria, because I would consider your life well worth my own,” he says icily.

Once I’m on my feet and no longer swaying, Giorgi releases me.

“We’re done today,” I tell everyone, but mostly her. “And if there’s anything wrong with Davy, I’ll figure out how to make you pay. You know I will.”

“He’ll be fine,” she says airily, as if she doesn’t have a knife to her throat. “You’re all always *so* dramatic.”

Liam removes the knife and she turns and walks away at the most deliberately sedate pace I have ever seen in my life.

I turn to Alex, “How is he?”

“His pulse was thready,” Alex says, “but it’s evening out now.”

“What happened?” I ask.

“After the first hour and a half, he started sweating,” Henry supplies.

“Hour and a half? How long has it been?”

“Almost two and a half hours,” Alex says softly.

“Fucking bitch,” I manage to bite out.

“Yeah, he needed a break, but she wouldn’t call time, and he wasn’t about to stop before then and make it worse,” Alex supplies.

I nod. “He made the smart choice.”

“*That* was smart?” Liam asks.

“Yes,” Alex and I both say simultaneously.

“All of our blood remains inside our bodies. It could have been worse,” I tell him. “Gods, I hate her,” I mutter.

“Come on,” Liam says to Alex. “I’ll help you get him to your room.”

Alex nods and they lift Davy together, moving ahead of the rest of us.

“You good?” Giorgi asks me.

“Yeah, I’m good,” I answer. “Amelia and the other one. Can you and Gavin explain the shit with the knot to them? Show them?”

He nods.

“Thanks,” I say as he moves to speak to Gavin.

“You look like shit,” Lisette tells me.

“Yeah. Well.” I shrug. “Still want to be able to do magic?” I ask her. “Because I think we’re going to have to do something like that with you.”

“Let me sleep on it,” she says with the first hint of trepidation I’ve seen from her.

“Good choice,” I say as she moves ahead and is replaced by Peter. “Fucking Peter,” I mutter once I’m sure he’s close enough to hear me.

“That looked pretty rough,” he tells me.

“Felt worse.”

“I’m sorry about earlier. With Liam.”

“Only because it earned you a busted face,” I say with certainty.

“Maybe. But you can’t honestly think keeping something like that from Liam is a good idea.”

“You’re right, but it’s still none of your business. You were trying to start a fight between us. What I can’t figure out is why. It’s okay though. I’ll get there eventually.”

“Because I’m an asshole,” he supplies.

“You are, but I think there’s more to it than that. I think you’re playing both sides against the middle.”

“If I am, I certainly don’t seem to be very good at it,” he comments drily, as he continues to walk next to me.

“Indeed.”

----

I make it back to the room Liam and I are occupying by myself, and Liam shows up about ten minutes after.

“How’s Davy?” I ask.

“The same, but Alex thinks he’ll be okay by the morning.”

I nod. “And Alex?”

“Angry. He’ll be fine though.”

“Okay. About Peter…”

“Yes?” Liam asks cautiously.

“How certain are you that you can trust him, because I swear he gives me the distinct impression he’s going to fuck us all over at any minute.”

“If you’d asked me a month ago, I would have told you I trusted him with my life,” Liam says, as he drags a hand across his face. “Now… I don’t know. I think I still trust him, but I’ll be damned if he isn’t making it difficult.”

“Okay,” I say. He believed me when I said something similar about Alex, so I do the same. “Tell me if that changes, please.”

“Yeah. I will.”

“Good. Are you okay?” I ask him.

“I was better before that stunt your mom pulled in the woods,” he says, enfolding me in his arms.

“I did tell you,” I remind him.

“I know. But it's different watching it happen first hand.”

“Yeah.”

### 6 - I Want to Be Sedated

It’s two days later and we’re all riding to the Lusigan port to board a ship and spend the next month and a half being bored out of our minds.

At least we’ll be heading back to Branton—where hopefully I’ll be able to get some answers—instead of hanging around that stupid house. And when we get back, Reese’s churro shop is going to be my first stop.

Liam told me a few days ago that he got the key for the Ginnelstreet flat from Reese. She told him it was his mother's. That may or may not be true, and I intend to find out. Either way, she knows a lot more than the rest of us. And I wouldn’t mind having some churros too. Two birds with one stone.

I wonder if she knew who I was the first time Liam brought me in. I wouldn’t have thought so, but if she was as close with my mother as Peter claims, she may have taken one look at me and figured it out.

If all these people could just mind their own fucking business, none of us would be in this mess.

The ship’s cramped enough that everyone but me has to watch their heads. It’s especially bad for the tall ones though. Alex, Liam, Peter, Gavin, and Lisette are about to have a rough time.

When I open the door to our cabin, I’ve never been more glad I don’t need much sleep. We’ll both be lucky to fit in the bed together.

“Well, this is cozy,” I say. “And to be clear, by cozy, I mean claustrophobic.” I throw my pack on the bed and then tell Liam, “I’m going back above deck.”

----

I’ve been leaning over the rail watching the land fade to nothing for a while. All I can see in any direction right now is water.

I turn my back to the rail and watch the crew. They’re busy and it looks more interesting than anything else happening here. I make my way over to the pilot.

“What kind of ship is this?” I ask him.

“A four masted barquentine. Good for dealing with the tricky wind conditions this time of year.”

“How long does it take to learn to sail one of these?”

“If you’re merely following someone else’s orders? And doing as you’re told? Not long. To give the orders? Ages. Why? You fancy a life at sea?”

“Considering it,” I say.

“You know anything about navigation?”

“A bit.”

“Takes more than a bit,” he tells me.

“I’m a quick study,” I respond.

A hand comes down on my shoulder. “Forgive my sister,” Alex says from behind me. “She’s easily bored. Like a small child.”

“Piss off,” I tell Alex. “I’m considering a career change.” Looking back at the pilot I ask, “How much trouble would I be in if I went up into the rigging?”

“A lot,” he answers, and he is not amused by my question.

“Figures,” I say. “Well on the off chance you need someone who isn’t afraid of heights and can climb, I’m available for at least the duration of this trip.”

I let Alex drag me away. “What do you want?” I grumble.

“Nothing. I just wanted to stop you from pissing the crew off on the very first day.”

“Fine. What do you think about Peter?”

“In what context?”

“Think he’s trustworthy?” I haven’t had the chance to talk to Alex much lately.

He shrugs. “Probably.”

“Then why does it feel like he’s waiting for the opportunity to stick a knife in my back?”

Alex shrugs. “Dunno. Mom plans to continue her training while we’re at sea.”

“Great.”

“She wants us all in the galley in an hour.”

“Super,” I respond, unenthusiastically.

“You should come now though,” he tells me.

“Why?”

“Because if you were smart, you’d spend the next six weeks eating to make up for the fact that you still look half starved.”

“Fine. Whatever. Lead on.”

Alex wends his way below deck, with me trailing along behind him. When we enter the galley, everyone else is already there. Peter, Gavin, Giorgi, and Henry are all playing dice.

“Dice,” I scoff in derision as I walk past.

“What’s wrong with dice?” Henry asks.

“All chance and no skill. It’s boring.”

“Well, I brought cards too,” Gavin says, as he scoops up the dice. “We can play poker later. As I recall, Liam is one up on you.”

I roll my eyes, but say, “Maybe.” It’s not like there’s anything else to do. And this is why I hate ships. Sitting around and eating, and eating and sitting around. The crew won’t even let you climb up into the rigging, which is arguably the only place on a ship worth being.

“Strip poker!” Gavin calls out from behind.

“Sounds like a terrible idea,” I say over my shoulder. “Count me in.”

“Me too!” Alex tells him.

Liam is sitting at a table with Davy, Lisette, Amelia, and Amelia’s cousin Michael who I don’t think I’ve said more than ten words to so far.

I sit down next to Liam, who immediately wraps an arm around me. “Strip poker?” he murmurs into my ear.

“Yes. Are you going to play?”

“Maybe. Did you convince anyone to let you up in the rigging,” he asks a bit louder.

“How did you know that’s what I was doing?”

Liam laughs. “You said the room was claustrophobic and then practically ran up to the deck. What else would you possibly be doing?”

“I could have just been getting some air,” I say.

“But you weren’t, were you?”

“No. Have you seen how tall the mast is?” I ask wistfully.

“Why would you want to go up there?” Michael asks.

“Why *wouldn’t* you?” I answer. “Imagine being up there in a storm,” I let myself daydream about it for a minute. “It would be glorious.”

Liam sighs.

“Behind you,” Lisette says with a nod.

I turn to find Davy and Alex carrying a cake. Damnit.

I close my eyes and sigh. Birthdays. I hate them. Mostly mine. But apparently this is mine.

“This is what you were planning? When I asked a couple of days ago?”

“Don’t sound so disappointed, sis,” Alex says. “It’s the first birthday we’ve all been together in *years*!”

“A streak we definitely should have continued,” I tell him. “Thank you for the cake,” I say, trying to be polite.

“It’s cinnamon flavored,” Alex informs me.

He looks so pleased that I say, “Thank you,” again and try to actually mean it. Once he and Davy set the cake down I stand and hug them both.

He bends down and whispers, “Also, I may have drugged mom and locked her in her room. Happy birthday!”

“Seriously?” I ask, completely stunned. “That’s… incredible. Okay. I might not completely hate this birthday.”

“See. Planning.”

I roll my eyes.

“And we have plenty of party favors.”

“So you’re basically going to force me to celebrate?” I question.

“Yes,” Davy answers, handing me a piece of cake and a shot of vodka. “That’s one. I’m counting.”

“Of?”

“Twenty eight. Obviously.”

“There’s no way,” I tell him.

“Not with an attitude like that,” he comments as he takes a shot. “Two an hour over the next fourteen hours? You’ll manage. Probably.”

“There are worse ways to die,” I say as I down the first shot and take a bite of cake.

It’s sometime after the fourth shot that Gavin convinces me to play dice with them, and I start flagrantly cheating. “All sixes, all the time!” I boast after the third such roll.

“We know you’re cheating,” Peter says.

“Then figure out how to stop me,” I respond with a grin.

“Oh, are we playing this game?” Alex asks from the next table over, suddenly interested.

He typically cares as much about games of chance as I do, which is not at all. If there’s not some amount of skill, some level of *earned* bragging rights involved at the end, count us both out. But cheating turns dice from a game of chance into a game of skill. Really, sometimes cheating *does* improve a game.

“You can’t beat me,” I tell him with a grin.

“We’ll see. Limitations?”

“None.”

“You’ll regret that.”

“Will I?” I ask, knowing it’s entirely possible.

“One twenty?”

“Sure.”

We’ve got five dice, with a high roll of all sixes having a maximum of thirty points. If you have more than a single one in a role, you score nothing for that roll. If you have more than three ones in a single roll, you lose all the points you’ve accumulated so far. First person to a hundred and twenty points wins. Simple.

I roll first. I can feel Alex trying to flip my dice, but I don’t let him. “Thirty points,” I say smugly.

He scowls at me, and picks up the dice. He cups his hands around them, shakes them, and lets them go. I manage to flip three of them to ones before they hit the table top.

“Oh, look at that. No points. How sad for you,” I snark.

I pick the dice up, and roll again. This time, as I release them, I feel something hit my chair, and it’s tipping backwards. I split my focus, in an effort to avoid bashing my head on the floor as my chair tips, and by the time my dice hit the table, three of them are ones.

“Oh, look at that. No points. How sad for you,” Alex says, mocking me.

“Playing dirty. I approve.”

By now, the others have all gathered around, hoping for blood, no doubt.

Alex rolls again, and this time I make sure four of his dice show one. Because I can.

I rest my chin on my hands and smile as he glares at me in frustration. Then I scoop the dice up. I don’t expect Alex to try the same thing twice in a row, but for good measure, I throw a shield up around myself before I roll. I feel magic batting at the shield, but nothing gets through. It’s five sixes again.

“Sixty-zero in my favor,” I tell him. “Your turn.”

“Davy, we need more shots,” Alex calls out, biding his time. When Davy appears, Alex grabs his arm, pulls him down and whispers something in his ear.

Davy nods and hands us both a glass which we immediately down.

“Still waiting, Alex.”

He nods and shakes the dice in his hand before throwing them. I go to flip them, but there’s a shield around Alex, which I take and another around the dice, which I also dismantle, but a second too slow.

Alex smiles broadly. “Thirty-sixty, sis.”

“We’ll see,” I say as I pick up the dice and roll again. Another thirty points to me. “You’re going to have to do better than that.”

“So it would seem. A moment, if you will,” he tells me. He turns and whispers something to Davy, then to Giorgi, then to Peter.

“Got all your ducks in a row?” I ask.

“Let’s find out,” he says, picking up the dice.

His strategy is the same as last time, and I’m faster, but so is he. He adds a little bit of magic to slam the dice down to the table faster than they would fall on their own, and ends up with another five sixes. Damn.

“That’s what? Sixty-ninety?”

“Not bad,” I comment, sweeping the dice into my hand. With all that whispering, I know he has something planned, I just don’t know what. I roll, and as I do, the ship surges, sending my dice flying off the table and onto the floor. By the time we find them all and check their faces, there are three ones.

“Very nice,” I say, but I’m annoyed. It *was* nice. I should’ve thought of it.

“Um, let’s not break the ship,” Henry comments, warily looking between me and Alex.

“Fine, I promise not to cause a shipwreck if Alex does the same,” I tell him.

Alex nods in agreement. “No shipwrecks,” he says, scooping up the dice and rolling.

He layers on a bit more, so now, in addition to everything that came before, I feel Peter, Giorgi, and Davy all working to influence the Dice in Alex’s favor, and I run out of time. Again. Damn!

“Ninety-ninety, sis,” Alex says smirking.

I scoop up the dice and release them in a single move. I don’t bother with any kind of shield. I throw all of my effort into making sure every dice has a six face-up, no matter where it lands. I put enough power into it that it doesn’t matter what Alex or anyone else in the room does. Enough that it definitely feels a bit chilly in the galley now.

“One twenty-ninety. Last roll.” I have no intention of letting him win. All I need is one die. No limitations. I grin. I got this.

He scoops up the dice, cups them in his hand and gives them a quick shake before releasing them. I see the emotions flicker across his face. He thinks the game has ended in a tie as the dice hit the table. Then it’s replaced by bewilderment, as he only counts four sixes. Only four dice. Then it’s incredulity, as he looks from the table to me, and I hold up four fingers.

“You… vaporized one of the dice?” he asks.

“No limitations,” I tell him, grinning like the cat that ate the canary.

“Nice,” he tells me appreciatively. “Very nice.”

“Thank you.”

----

It’s many shots later when Davy pops up and asks, “Are you drunk enough yet?”

“Drunk enough for… ?” I question curiously.

“Dimmi.”

“Where the hell did you get dimmi? But also yes. Definitely.”

“I used to grow it when we all were living together in Leisch. Turns out some of it’s still there.”

“You were growing it and you never told me?” I ask, mildly outraged.

“Of course I didn’t tell you. You would have smoked it faster than I could grow it,” he answers, which fair.

“Dimmi? You guys are going to smoke dimmi?” Michael asks, with what sounds like a hint of reproach in his voice.

“Have you ever tasted colors Michael?” I ask. If you smoke dimmi while sober, it only burns like acid in your lungs. But if you’re drunk enough, dimmi creates a high complete with synesthesia. It’s truly the best drug there is. Hard to find, though.

He shakes his head.

“You should try it before you knock it,” I tell him.

“But it’s dimmi!”

“And? Davy spends most of his time hanging out with degenerates in dives,” I state.

Gavin waves at Michael, and says, “Hello, that’s us, in case it wasn’t clear.”

“Alex has functionally no morals whatsoever, and I’ve never encountered a rule I’m not just willing, but eager, to break. You saw Liam hold a knife to my mother’s throat a couple of days ago. Henry and Lisette decided it sounded like more fun to risk their lives hanging out with us than whatever it is they’d be doing otherwise. We’re basically the people your parents warned you about growing up,” I say with a shrug. “And interestingly, your parents somehow still thought you should come with us.”

I take a long inhale from the pipe Davy passes me before handing it off to Alex, who takes a drag before passing it off to Liam, who—to my surprise, despite my words—does the same before passing it on.

Maybe we’re all feeling the impending doom. I know I’ve definitely decided hedonism seems like the best course of action for the foreseeable future.

By the time it makes its way to Amelia, everyone else has decided they’re game. “Live a little, Michael,” she tells him, taking a hit and handing it to him.

I’m curious to see if he’ll bow to the peer pressure. I see him waver momentarily, before he finally says, “Fine.”

Gavin cheers, and soon everyone else is joining him.

“Let’s go topside and taste some colors!” I tell everyone.

----

It’s bright the next morning. So damn bright. It’s the brightness that wakes me up stabbing into my eyes even though they’re closed. I have no idea what time it is, but based on the way I feel, I’m pretty sure it’s too early. I move to block the sun from my eyes and realize that wherever I am, it’s definitely not a bed, or our cabin. I try to decide if I care, and if it wasn’t for the sun stabbing into my eyes like tiny, little ice picks, I’d go back to sleep. Despite that, I think I might try, until I feel the pillow beneath my head shifting. *No, not a pillow,* I groggily realize. *A person.*

*I guess I’d better open my eyes,* I think.

When I do, I see Liam’s lower back is currently serving as my pillow. He’s lying face down on the deck of the ship. Naked. And the view in the morning sunlight is not bad. It’s actually pretty damn good. I’m distracted enough that it takes a few minutes before I realize that, except for the sailcloth someone has draped over me, I’m in exactly the same state. I grin.

It was apparently a very good night.

My last memory is of a strip poker game, which I evidently lost, and then proclaiming I was going to go climb the foremast.

“Ah, so you’re awake, are you?” someone asks.

“No, definitely not,” I answer the mystery voice.

“Well, do you think you could be not awake somewhere off my deck, then?”

I look around trying to find the voice, and finally locate the pilot I was speaking to yesterday.

“Mmm. What happened?”

“You came up here at dawn, on a tear, saying you were going to climb up into the rigging. No one was willing to grab you—to stop you—on account of, well,” he says waving at me. “You weren’t lying when you said you could climb. You were onto the main yard quick as could be, not listening to anyone telling you to get your ass back onto the deck until yon man showed up,” he nods toward Liam.

“Him you listened to. Then you came back down and refused to go to your cabin. By that point we were just glad to have you out of our rigging,” he says with a shrug, as if that explains everything. “Amazed you didn’t dash your brains all over my deck,” he mutters.

“Please. I could climb that mast while drunk, blindfolded, and stoned in the middle of a gale,” I scoff.

“Aye. You might be able to at that,” he admits. “Anyway. Whenever you want to get off my deck.”

“Fine, fine,” I grumble to the pilot. “Liam. Hey, Liam.”

“What?” he croaks.

“Ship’s pilot says we’ve overstayed our welcome.”

“Where are we?”

“On the deck. Naked.”

“What happened?”

“We had a *very* good night,” I answer.

### 7 - How Soon Is Now?

A couple of days later, I’m staring over the shoulder of the ship’s pilot, who I’ve since learned is called Lewis—I think it’s a surname, but he didn’t specify and I didn’t ask. I’m peering at his charts and at our heading, and it doesn’t look right.

“Where are we sailing?” I ask him.

“Yonder,” he tells me, gesturing vaguely in front of us.

“Yonder, where? This isn’t the right heading to take us to Branton.”

His brow furrows as he casts a glance back my way. “I thought you only knew ‘a bit’ about navigation.”

“I know enough to know this heading isn’t right.” I’m certain of it. “So. Yonder, where?”

“Ask the ice queen.”

“The ice queen? My mother?”

“Aye.”

I close my eyes and take a breath.

“Yonder where, Lewis? I know you know.”

“All I know,” he says, “is we’re picking up a passenger in Montebal before sailing to Branton.”

“Do you know the passenger’s name?”

“No.”

“How soon until we make port in Montebal?”

“Two days.”

I nod, and walk away to find Davy. A few minutes later, I find him playing cards on the deck with Gavin, Peter, and Giorgi. They all look very relaxed and, at least for Davy, I’m about to ruin it. I briefly consider delaying telling him the news I’m about to deliver, but quickly dismiss the idea. He deserves to know.

“Familiar scene,” I say by way of greeting.

“Hey, Hazel,” Gavin responds.

“Hey, Gavin. You guys mind if I steal Davy for a minute?”

Davy narrows his eyes, but stands to walk with me.

I walk towards the stern, and lean on the railing once I find a spot with no one nearby. Davy joins me.

“Well?” he asks.

“I was hanging out with Lewis, the pilot,” I begin. “Looking at his charts and such, and I noticed our heading isn’t quite right.”

“Not ‘quite right’ in what sense?”

“Well, we’re not exactly headed toward Branton. According to Lewis, we’re stopping to pick up a passenger first, then heading to Branton.”

“A passenger?”

“Yeah. He didn’t know who. Only where.”

“Okay, where?” Davy says, asking the obvious question.

“Montebal,” I answer flatly.

“Fuck,” Davy sighs, dropping his head to rest on his hands on top of the wooden railing, brown curls spilling over them. “How soon?”

“Two days.”

“Okay.”

“Sorry.”

----

It’s a bit after noon, almost exactly forty-eight hours later, when we anchor in a protected cove, and a dinghy begins rowing to shore. Lewis knows what he’s about. I’ll give him that.

I wait, staring over the port railing, waiting for chaos incarnate to appear. Alex and Liam stand next to me, and the look Alex wears is as grim as my own. Liam has no idea what’s coming.

Davy isn’t on the deck. He started drinking at breakfast and I don’t think he’s stopped since. Last I checked, Gavin and Henry were keeping him company. Probably still are.

I sigh. At least with my mother, you know what you’re in for. It’s all bad, but you know that, and you’re prepared for it. Christine Iverson is an entirely different kind of nightmare. She can be great. She can make you think you’re the most important person in the world—that the sun rises and sets with you. And then she can be terrible. Maybe she’ll merely seem to forget you exist at all. Or maybe she’ll actively work to undermine you and cut you down. Or maybe she’ll abandon you entirely, and leave you at the mercy of someone who would just as soon kill you as feed you. And maybe she’ll show back up in a month, or a year, or a decade. Or maybe not. If she does reappear, maybe you’ll be the most interesting thing in the world to her again for a few days. Or maybe it’ll be like you’ve never met before.

It’s almost worse, because when things are good, you can almost love her. At least until you learn better. And I think Davy’s still trying to figure out exactly how long it takes to learn better.

It’s been fifteen years since he last saw her. The last time she dumped him with us and disappeared, he was seventeen and she never came back. As far as I know, he hasn’t heard a word from her since.

“She’s going to try to sleep with Liam,” Alex says out of nowhere.

“You think?” I ask as Liam snorts in either disbelief or amusement. Maybe both.

“Yeah,” he tells me. “She’s propositioned me before, so…”

“Wow. I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised. And yet.”

“Yeah. I should probably warn the others too,” Alex says with a sigh.

We fall back into silence as the dinghy begins rowing back toward the ship. Another ten minutes and it’s coming alongside the ship and she’s climbing aboard.

She looks older than the last time I saw her, with silver starting to thread through the same dark curls Davy has. She’s still drop dead gorgeous though. When she finally makes it to the deck, I notice we’re now matched in height. She’ll be the only other person on this ship who doesn’t have to watch her head as she moves about. Shame.

“Hazel! My darling!” Christine says as she wraps her arms around me. I don’t return her embrace.

She releases me and flings her arms around Alex next. When she releases him she turns an appraising gaze to Liam and asks, “*Who* is this handsome gentleman?”

“Liam,” he says, introducing himself, “Hazel’s boyfriend.”

“Hmm,” Christine murmurs before casting a speculative glance at me.

One of the ship’s crew comes along to take her to her room, and she leaves without inquiring about Davy at all.

“Well, shall we go warn Davy she’s here?”

Alex nods, and we go below deck. We find a very drunk Davy in the galley with Gavin. At some point between when I saw him earlier this morning and now, he’s cut off all his hair. What was three or four inches of curls is now no longer than the width of a finger. It actually looks better than I would have expected.

“Nice hair. I like it,” I tell him.

“Thanks,” he responds with a nod that would probably have him falling over if Gavin wasn’t propping him up.

“She’s here,” I warn him.

“I don’t care!” he tells us all loudly.

“Yes, we got that from the hair,” Alex remarks with more than a hint of amusement.

“I don’t!” Davy says again, a bit louder and more emphatic, like that will make it truer.

“We know. Want us to kill her for you?” I ask. I’m only halfway joking.

“Would you?” he asks me.

“Probably,” I answer with a shrug.

“Let me think about it.”

“You do that.”

“I’m going to go warn the others,” Alex says to me and Liam. Then looking at Gavin, he says, “Don’t sleep with Davy’s mom.”

“Got it,” Gavin tells Alex.

“Ugh. I think I might be sick,” Davy mumbles.

I grab an empty pot and shove it at him. “Let’s go get some air,” I say, sliding under his shoulder and relieving Gavin. Slowly we make our way topside. I lead us toward the fourth mast and we sit next to it, since I don’t want Davy anywhere near the railings.

“Did she ask about me?” he asks quietly, with his head between his knees.

“No.”

Somehow, he manages to slump a little bit more.

“I shouldn’t care,” he says. “But I do.”

“I know,” I say softly. I don’t need to tell him that his mother is a terrible person. He already knows. It doesn’t matter though. “I really do like the hair. It suits you.” We sit in silence for a while before I ask, “Are you going to be okay?”

“I’ll be fine,” he tells me. “We’re always fine, right?”

“Right.”

### 8 - Reasons I Drink

The days on ship go by in a monotonous succession, where one day is much the same as the next. My mother insists everyone gets together each day, typically in the galley, away from the crew, so she can teach them. Or us? Or me? At this point, I’m not even sure who the target of these lessons is. It’s more nonsense with the energy meridians, except I think it’s percolating into my subconscious and it’s starting to make a terrifying kind of sense. I can feel my own energy meridians, and I think I can feel how they could be manipulated, and it’s like this whole realm of untapped magical potential. It’s making me nervous. Like I need even more power. I want to tell her to stop before some invisible line is crossed. I want to scream it at her until she shuts up, but I can’t. So instead, I sit there every day listening, and my anxiety swells.

I’m sure Liam has noticed, but I don’t think I can explain this growing dread—the unease that has me steps away from a panic attack every second I’m awake. Liam and Alex have been talking about it. About me. And about Davy. Davy’s been withdrawn since his mother appeared, and we’ve spent more than our fair share of nights atop the main yard, sitting together in silence. Usually drinking. Occasionally not. Lewis has given up and told the rest of the crew to leave us be. I think he’s decided it’s the safest course of action for all parties. He’s not wrong.

I know Liam and Alex both want us to talk to them. But neither Davy nor I want to. Or are ready to. Or able to.

We’re all a little frustrated with each other, and the close quarters aren’t helping. I think everyone else is experiencing their own mixture of boredom and frustration too. Frustration with my mother’s classes. Frustration with each other. Boredom due to the sameness of every day. We have at least another two weeks. We all need some space to think and a little room to breathe. And with the exception of the time Davy and I are spending sitting in the rigging, we’re not getting it.

----

It’s probably around three in the morning when I finally climb down, leaving Davy to stare at the stars alone. Lewis is still at the helm. I think the man sleeps even less than I do. It’s actually kind of impressive.

“Good night, Lewis,” I say as I pass him.

He nods in response.

I quietly enter the cabin Liam and I are sharing, shutting the door softly behind me so I don’t wake him. I strip off my clothes and lie down in the dark. But evidently he’s not asleep, or maybe I woke him when I came in, despite trying to be quiet. Either way, he pulls me closer to him when I lie down.

“You’re awake?” I whisper.

“Yeah, can’t sleep.”

“Sorry, I would have come sooner if I’d known.”

“It’s okay,” he murmurs into my hair.

“Why can’t you sleep?” I ask him.

“I’m… worried, I guess, about everything that’s going to happen when we get back to Branton.”

“Yeah, me too. But not worried, so much as filled with dread,” I admit, as I turn to face him.

“Is that what’s going on with you?” he asks, as he pushes my hair back from where it’s fallen into my face, letting his fingers skim across my cheek.

“Yes. No. I don’t know,” I sigh, and say again, “I don’t know. The dread—it’s bigger than that. It’s all this stuff with my mother and what she’s teaching everyone.”

“What do you mean?”

“I don’t know. I can’t even explain it to myself. Or I don’t want to. I don’t know,” I admit, repeating myself, because the fact that I don’t know is the only thing I’m really sure of.

“Okay.”

We stay silently entwined in one another’s arms for a few minutes before Liam tells me, “You know Alex is worried about you. And about Davy.”

“I know. We’ll both be fine.”

“Because you’re always fine?”

“Yes.”

“You don’t have to be, you know. Neither does Davy.”

“I know. Is it okay if we don’t talk about it anymore?” I ask. “I want to lie here with you and not think about it.”

“Alright,” he tells me, pulling me closer, and tucking my head under his chin.

I slowly try to escape from the anxiety that has me firmly locked in its grip, and let the feel of his skin against mine lull me into a dreamless sleep.

----

The next morning, Lisette finds me standing behind Lewis. I immediately realize she’s there, but say nothing. One minute turns into five. Then ten. Twenty.

“What are these markings on the chart?” I ask Lewis, pointing to an area between the coast of the continent and Kebdain, a large island that’s probably close to a fifteenth the size of the continent.

Lewis glances over to see what I’m pointing at. “Currents meet there. There’s a cold current flowing south and a warm one moving northeast. Makes the area dangerous.”

“Do we sail through it or go around?”

“This time of year, we’ll go around,” he tells me.

“What are you doing?” Lisette finally asks me.

“Learning.”

“About sailing?”

“About lots of things.”

It’s true. I’m learning about sailing, and charts, and navigation. But I’m also learning about commanding a ship full of people. Ostensibly this ship has a captain, but he doesn’t matter. Everyone on this ship answers to Lewis, and if it ever came down to it and they were forced to choose between their captain’s orders, or Lewis’s, they would all follow Lewis’s without a second thought given. The really interesting thing though, is Lewis wouldn’t let it come down to that. He manages the captain as well as he manages everything else onboard this ship. He’s truly masterful at it. I don’t even think most of the others realize it. Lisette certainly doesn’t seem to.

“Why do we go around this time of year?” I ask Lewis.

“Ice floes, fog, storms. Too many things can go wrong.”

“Do all ships avoid it this time of year?”

“All the smart ones do. Most of the ones that don’t will end up on the seafloor.”

“But in the summers you can go through?”

“If you’re careful. Aye.”

“Hmm. What do you make of all this?”

“All what?” he asks carefully.

“This,” I say, gesturing to the ship, Lisette, myself. All of it. “You must have some idea what we’re on about.”

“I know how to mind my business,” he tells me, clearly wanting to put an end to this particular topic. I decide I’ll let him. For now.

“What do you want, Lisette?” I finally ask her, since she obviously has something on her mind and isn’t going to broach it on her own.

“I want you to do it,” she says quickly, her hands clenched into fists.

“You’re sure?” I ask. “Because you don’t look sure.”

“I’m sure.”

“Fine. But not until we’re off the ship.”

“Why?”

“Lewis, do you want me doing it on your ship?”

“No.”

“He doesn’t even know what ‘it’ is!” Lisette says hotly.

“Doesn’t matter. He said no.”

“He’s just the pilot! It’s not even his ship.”

“Hah!” I snort as I observe the look Lewis gives her. “Well, he certainly won’t be teaching *you* to read the charts. Also, if you think it’s not his ship, you haven’t been paying attention.”

“It’s not my ship,” Lewis agrees.

“Please. This isn’t your ship the same way these aren’t my people,” I tell him flatly.

Lewis raises his eyebrows slightly, and I think maybe he dips his head minutely in what might be a nod, but I’m not sure.

“Whatever,” Lisette says. “Your mother wants you in the galley.”

“Great,” I mutter as I leave Lewis and head that way.

I find her in the galley, already waiting. Alex, Davy, Liam, and Christine are all there too. Davy is standing as far away from his mother as he can without making it obvious that’s what he’s doing.

“When we return to Branton, you and Davy will gather your things. Then we will all be journeying from Branton to Corriven to take care of the administrative details. From Corriven, you and Davy will go to Dairuvar. Christine will accompany you. Alex and I will go to Avonare,” she says, staring at me.

“Fine,” I answer. I knew this was coming. I’ve been waiting.

It’s not fine.

“Good,” she remarks, clearly having expected me to argue with her. “Very well. That will be all.”

We file out of the room and Alex looks at me, and asks sharply, “*Fine*? This is not *fine*.”

I shake my head at him. And gesture for them all to follow me, and then I go to find Gavin. When I do, he’s lounging toward the rear of the deck with Peter and Giorgi. Good.

“Hey guys, you busy?” I ask them.

“So busy,” Gavin tells me. “The clouds are very interesting today. We’re keeping a close eye on them.”

“Someone has to,” Giorgi quips.

“Indeed. Well, can you come with me? Lewis, the ship’s pilot, would like to have a word with you all.”

This earns me several peculiar looks, but they get up, and the seven of us walk toward the helm.

“Hey, Lewis. You said you wanted to talk to these three about spending so much time lying about on your deck,” I say as we approach.

Lewis raises his eyebrows, having definitely said no such thing.

“When he gets done telling you guys off,” I say with a glance to Gavin, “you should ask him about his time with the Firgasu navy. I’m sure he could talk for ages about it.”

“You three are a hazard to the rest of the crew,” Lewis tells them flatly, taking the hint, and I step back a couple of feet with Liam, Davy, and Alex. I make sure to stay close enough to the others that it looks like we could all be involved in the same conversation, before throwing up a shield around the four of us.

“No one should be able to hear us,” I tell them, “but keep your voices down just in case. Better safe than sorry.”

“I take it we’re not going to Dairuvar, then,” Liam says.

“No, we’re not even going to Branton, at least not on this ship, but there was no reason to bother telling her that.”

Alex visibly breathes a sigh of relief. “So you haven’t been spending all your time with Lewis because you’re bored out of your mind?”

“No. I mean, it kind of started out that way, but we can’t go back to Branton with her. Or at least *I* can’t,” I tell them. “Lewis is key to getting off this ship well before that.”

“Does Lewis know this?” Davy asks.

“Not yet. But he’ll help.”

“You’re sure?”

“Yes.”

“Just the four of us?” Liam questions.

“Anyone you don’t mind bringing to the flat, because that’s where we’re all going to need to go.”

“Gavin and Giorgi,” Liam says quickly.

“Peter?” I ask.

Liam looks at Alex, seeking his opinion on Peter, I guess.

“Yeah, Peter too,” Alex confirms.

“What about Henry, Lisette, and Amelia?” I inquire, before quickly stating, “We’re *not* taking Michael.”

“Why not Michael?” Liam asks, and Davy looks curious as well.

I sigh. “He’s been sleeping with Christine.”

“Go figure,” Davy mutters darkly.

“Not Amelia either, then. She’s a bit unpredictable at the best of times, but with her loyalties divided like that? No,” Liam tells me.

“And Henry and Lisette?”

“How long before we need to decide?”

“It’ll probably be about a week until we abandon ship, so to speak,” I answer.

“Think about it until then?” Liam asks us all.

We nod.

“What about Liam?” Alex asks, looking at me. “Mom’s going to be pissed when she wakes up and we’re all gone.”

“She won’t kill him,” I say with far more certainty than I feel.

“She might,” Alex says, I think more for Liam’s awareness than mine. “You know how vindictive she can be.”

“If she kills him, she knows she’s next. She’ll have to hold off. Besides, she’ll want to try to figure out how to get us all back under her thumb, and killing Liam won’t accomplish that.”

“Maybe,” Alex says.

“It’s your call Liam,” I tell him.

“We should go,” he agrees. “It’s the least bad option.”

“Alright. I’m going to drop the shield before anyone gets too suspicious.” I don’t warn them all to keep their mouths shut. They’re not stupid.

“So have you ever seen any sea monsters?” I hear Gavin asking Lewis. He shrugs when I look at him in question.

“Sea monsters don’t exist, Gavin.”

“I wouldn’t be so sure, lass,” Lewis says.

I roll my eyes and the conversation continues on.

----

That night, as Davy and I sit together on the main yard, he seems to be in a slightly better mood. After we’ve been up there for an hour or so, silently staring into the night, I feel his magic wrap around us both, and add my own to it.

“We should bring Lisette,” he says after a few moments. “You’re going to need her.”

“How do you figure?”

“You’re not the only one who’s been paying attention to Alexandria’s lessons,” he tells me.

I sigh.

“Yeah. I don’t like it either, but you’re going to need someone to work it out on, and I don’t see a whole lot of other willing volunteers.”

“I know. I’ve been thinking the same thing. For weeks now. And I really don’t like it.”

“I know. So here’s what I’m thinking. If you can actually open her energy meridians, or whatever,” Davy begins, waving a hand in the air.

“I’m pretty sure I can,” I say softly.

“Good. Then when you do, you should make doing it contingent upon letting you do to her what you did to the deer. No,” he says quickly, “don’t look at me like that. She’ll agree. You won’t be taking anything she isn’t willing to offer.”

“I know. I don’t have to like it though.”

“No, you don’t. But you also can’t afford to give up an advantage.”

I nod, because he’s right. I can’t. I hate it. But I can’t.

“Here’s the real question,” he says, watching me carefully. “If you can expand them or create them, can you also collapse them?”

“Maybe. I don’t know. I think so. Probably.”

“I think so too. I think it’s worth trying to figure out.”

“Yeah, I know, but again, an issue with the volunteers.”

“I mean, they’re not exactly volunteers, but there are a couple of people on this ship who deserve it.” Davy says flatly.

“True, but I’m not going to try it out until after I’ve done whatever I can do with Lisette, and I’m not doing that until *after* we’re off the ship.”

Davy shrugs. “I’m sure there will be other opportunities.”

“Doesn’t it bother you?” I ask, because it bothers me.

“What?”

“What I’m capable of.”

“No. You don’t want any of it. If you started wanting it, it *might* start bothering me. Maybe.”

“You have a lot more faith in me than I do.”

“I know,” he says. “I always have.”

I don’t bother to contradict him, because he’s right. “I need to go talk to Lewis,” I tell him, as I quickly move to the mast and back down to the deck.

----

I find Lewis at the helm, because where else would he be?

“Are there two of you?” I ask. “Like, do you have a secret identical twin? Because you sleep even less than I do, and I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone who sleeps less than I do.”

“No,” he chuckles as he answers. “But there’s always someone better than you at something.”

“That’s what I’m afraid of,” I mutter. “You never answered me earlier.”

“Didn’t I?” he responds, notably not asking what he neglected to answer.

“You didn’t.” I wait silently, just off his shoulder.

Eventually, he sighs. “As far as I can tell, you don’t particularly seem to want to be here. Or rather, here with these people. Especially the one who looks like you.”

“My mother,” I say nodding.

“If you can call her that.”

“Yeah.”

We stand silently for a while, the only sounds are the wind creaking through the sails, and the waves slapping against the hull of the ship as it slices through the water.

“I think it’s a bad business,” he says finally. “All of it.”

“Likewise.” I throw my magic around us. “If I wanted to get off this ship before Branton, where would I do it?”

“You? Or you and yours?”

“Me and mine.”

He thinks for a moment, and then moves the chart around, before finally pointing and saying, “Here. Cape Deila.”

I nod. “And when will we reach Cape Deila.”

“About five days from now.”

“At night?”

“If that’s what you want.”

“Sometime between two and three in the morning would be best.”

“What are you going to do when you make land?”

“Start walking.”

He nods. “Long way,” he states.

“I’ve walked further.”

“Have the others?”

I shrug. “They’ll manage.”

“Aye. I expect so.”

### 9 - We’re Going Home

Five nights later, Liam and I stand on the deck with Davy, Alex, and Peter. Gavin and Giorgi have gone to get Henry and Lisette. Davy was right in saying we should bring Lisette, and if we’re bringing her, then Henry is an obvious choice as well. We didn’t tell either of them beforehand, which is why Gavin and Giorgi are fetching them now.

There’s a strong wind coming from the east, and the water is choppy. Lewis is going to get in as close to the shore of the cape as the barquentine can manage, but we’ll be rowing the dinghy a decent way, and we need to get the timing right. I’m waiting *very* impatiently.

A few minutes later Gavin and Lisette appear, and another minute later, Giorgi and Henry follow. The dinghy is already in the water, and we start climbing down into it. Gavin first, followed by Lisette, Giorgi, then Henry. Peter goes next, and Liam follows him. Then Alex, and Davy.

Lewis hands me a rolled sheet of paper, and says, “Better get going.”

“Thanks,” I nod, meeting his eyes as the wind whips my hair around my face.

Seconds later, I’m joining the others in the dinghy. Alex and Peter take up the oars, and begin rowing us toward the shoreline.

“What’s that?” Gavin asks, nodding to the rolled sheet of paper I’m holding.

“Not sure,” I tell him, sliding it into my pack. It’s too dark to read anything now. There’s a new moon and the sky has a thick, low layer of clouds covering the stars.

Fifteen minutes later, we make it to the shore. So far, so good, but I know it’s only a matter of time and probably not much at that. Eventually, she’s bound to notice Liam’s getting further away from her, and when she does…

“Let’s move,” I tell the others. “We’ve got a long way to walk, and the sooner we make it back, the better.”

We’re lucky the coast here isn’t sheer cliffs or thickly wooded, but waist high scrubland. There is no road or trail though, so it’s rough going as we traverse across it, but it could be a lot worse. Lewis chose well.

“How long is it going to take us to make it back to Branton?” Henry asks.

“Probably a few weeks,” Alex answers.

“So they’ll make it back before we do,” Henry says with a nod.

“Still better this way,” Giorgi comments, and I have to agree.

----

I hear Liam take a ragged breath that turns into a strangled gasp after we’ve been walking for a couple of hours. I’m surprised it took this long honestly. I expected it much sooner.

“Stop,” I call out to the others, and drop my pack. I take Liam’s face in my hands. “Stay calm,” I tell him as I stare into his eyes. “She’s not going to kill you. I know it feels like it, but she’s *not* going to kill you.”

“Hazel,” I hear someone say warningly.

“She’s not going to kill him,” I say again. “I’m sure.” I’m not sure. There are few things I have ever felt less sure of. I look back into Liam’s eyes and tell him again, “You’re going to be fine,” as I slowly watch him lose consciousness, and fall to his knees. I hold on to his shoulders to keep him from falling face first into the earth.

*She’s not going to kill him. She’s not going to kill him.* I repeat to myself, again and again, willing it to be true. I wish I was more sure, as one minute stretches to two. And then two minutes stretches to three. I feel my own chest tightening, and begin to worry I was wrong, when he finally takes a breath. As he does, I let out the breath I was holding, and slowly sink to my knees.

“We’ll stay here until he wakes up,” I tell everyone else, shortly.

“That was close, sis,” Alex says softly as he settles beside me.

I only nod, because I’m not sure I can say anything else without my voice shaking and giving me away. I take my pack and slide it under Liam’s head, as Alex helps me move him onto his back.

“He’ll be fine,” Alex reassures me.

I simply nod, and curl up next to Liam, hating that I’m the sort of person who’s willing to gamble with his life.

“You did the right thing, Hazel.”

“I wasn’t sure,” I admit softly.

“But you were *right*.”

----

At some point, I must have fallen asleep because daylight has replaced the slow creep to dawn, and I hear birdsong in the distance. I see Liam and Peter several feet away talking quietly. Peter notices I’m awake first and says something to Liam which has him quickly looking in my direction. Liam nods and claps Peter on the shoulder, then heads back to me.

“Are you okay?” I ask as he reaches me.

“I’m fine. Are you?”

“Can we talk about it later?” I don’t feel like answering that question with a single modicum of honesty in the middle of a group of people.

“As long as you’ll actually talk to me about it later.”

I nod and reach for my pack. Now that it’s daylight, I want to see what the paper Lewis handed me has on it. Unrolling it, I see it’s a chart of the land where we are, and he marked out a route back to Branton which looks like it will be faster than what I likely would have picked with no reference material to go off of.

“Anyone have a compass?” I ask. I could probably wing it well enough without one, but having one would definitely be better.

“Yes,” Peter begins digging around his pack. “Here,” he says, tossing me a compass.

“Excellent. Where are Gavin, Giorgi, and Henry?” I ask, ready to get moving.

“Checking the snares,” Peter tells me.

“Snares?”

“We’ll need food. Giorgi and Gavin set snares after we stopped.”

“Ah. Good idea.” I don’t bother mentioning I could simply lure some animals to their deaths, because it *was* a good idea, and I don’t know how long it would have taken for me to get hungry enough to bother. Certainly well after everyone else. It also seems like it’s probably best to keep that information to myself for now.

I should have them show me how the snares work next time we stop, though. Could be useful.

Ten or fifteen minutes later, the three of them are filtering back in, carrying five rabbits. Definitely useful. They skin and butcher the rabbits quickly, and within the hour we’re all eating. I’m studying the chart Lewis left me, and even on the shortened route he mapped out, it leaves us about four hundred miles to get back to Branton. If we manage twenty miles a day, it’ll take us twenty days to get back. That’s too long. At twenty-five miles a day, we’ll make it back in sixteen days, which is better but still longer than I would like. Ideally, we would be back now.

“We need to cover at least twenty-five miles a day,” I tell the others. I’m annoyed that actual teleportation is beyond the bounds of what magic is capable of. Sure, I could approximate something that looked like it over a very short distance, but the energy requirements over any sizable distance for a group of people would be astronomical. I’d die before I could manage it, and so would everyone and everything around me.

Oh well. Getting off the ship was the least bad choice.

“Lisette,” I say, and wait for her attention to shift to me. “Tonight?” I’d just as soon get this over with.

“Okay,” she nods.

I sigh internally. I think I was hoping she’d say no, and back out. Maybe she still will, but I doubt it. Great.

“Let’s go,” I say as soon as everyone is done eating.

The terrain is rough. We’re not quite bushwhacking, but we’re not far off from it either. We’re probably covering about two and a half miles an hour, so we’ll be hiking into the dark, which means we’ll be moving even slower. All in all, it’ll probably take us fourteen hours to cover the twenty-five miles, and that’s if we don’t stop for breaks. I try to increase the pace, but in less than an hour, the others are telling me to slow down.

### 10 - King of Pain

Everyone is tired by the time we stop for the night. I can see the strain on their faces, and I know at least a few of them probably have some blisters that need tending. I leave that for Alex to deal with. He’s not exactly *better* at it than I am insofar as the end result will be the same. But it will hurt less if Alex does it. I’ve never been able to completely stop an injury from hurting while I heal it. Probably because I don’t care. If it hurts, it hurts. Eventually it will stop.

Gavin, Giorgi, and Henry are going off to set some snares. I want to go with them. Instead, I sit down and wait for Lisette. A few minutes later she’s standing in front of me.

“Let’s do it,” she says.

“Okay. Sit. I want to explain some things before we do this.”

“Are you going to try to talk me out of it?” she asks.

“No, but I want to make sure you know what you’re signing up for.”

She finally sits down, and as she does, Peter comes over and sits across from us to listen. I ignore him. Liam sits next to Peter, and Alex and Davy come and sit to either side of me. Great. I have an audience. I sigh.

“So first of all, this is going to hurt. Probably a lot.”

“How much is a lot?”

“You remember back in the clearing, in Leisch?” I ask.

She nods.

“What we did there was like a heavily modified version of this. Davy was moving energy through me, and it hurt. A lot. And my meridians, or whatever,” I hate how it sounds saying ‘energy meridians’ aloud, but I also don’t have a better term, “are actually… open? I guess. As far as I can tell, yours aren’t. So we need to open them, or maybe create them. I’m not sure. Anyway. I expect it’s going to hurt a lot more. *A lot more.* It will easily be the most painful thing you have ever experienced. And maybe if I had done this before, I could mitigate that. But I haven’t, and I’m not even going to try,” I tell her simply.

“That’s the second thing. It should go without saying, but I’m going to say it anyway, so we’re clear: I have never done this before. It might work. It might not. It might kill you. But regardless of what the outcome is, I can guarantee it’s going to be painful.

“Here’s the third thing. The thing I really want you to think about before we do this. This is going to bind you to me. Permanently. If it works, it’s going to make it so that I can pull power through you forever.”

“But I’ll also be able to move it through myself?” she asks.

“If it works. Yes. *If* it works.”

“Okay. Let’s do it.”

It’s exactly what I knew she was going to say. Exactly what I was *afraid* she was going to say.

“Alright. Give me a couple of minutes to talk to Davy and Alex,” I tell her, standing. I jerk my head to the left, and they both follow me as I start moving.

Once the three of us are a couple dozen feet away from the others, I put up a shield to stop our conversation from traveling back to them.

“Is anyone else nervous about how much she wants this?” I ask Davy and Alex.

Alex nods in agreement. “Yes.”

“If someone had given me that speech, I think I’d be a little bit more hesitant,” I comment.

“You’re right, and it’s not ideal, but I think you should do it. She’s what we’ve got to work with. Just make damn sure the connection is a one way connection,” Davy tells me.

I nod, having already come to the same conclusion. I’m actually planning on doing one better, and weaving into the magic something that will kill her outright if she tries to draw power from me or otherwise modify the bond. I have enough doubts about this whole thing that I want to be as sure as I can. And I don’t feel nearly sure enough. But I’m still going to do it. Maybe Peter was right. Maybe I do like playing with fire. Maybe I do want to see how close I can get without getting burned.

Eventually I know I’m going to go up in flames though. A great, spectacular conflagration. I just hope this time isn’t it.

“Okay. Can I get one of you guys to hold her in place? Still-still. Barely breathing still. I don’t want to have to split my attention doing that as well.”

“Yeah, I’ll do it,” Alex tells me.

“Thanks.” I sigh. “Davy, can you make sure no one interferes? I don’t think anyone will, but make sure.”

He nods.

“Well, I guess there’s nothing to it but to do it,” I say before letting the shield fall and walking back to Lisette.

I sit down in front of her again. “Alex is going to hold you in place while we do this,” I tell her. “I need to make sure you’re still, and I don’t think you’ll be able to stay still without someone forcing you to.”

I wait for her to nod, and then wait until I feel Alex’s power wrap around her before I take her hands in mine. I close my eyes, and instead of falling backward into myself, like I normally would, I focus on falling inward to the spot where her hands are resting against mine.

From here, I begin the first tentative steps of binding her to me, and send my power questing into her, along where I think her energy meridians should be. And I feel them. Kind of. But instead of being like paths or grooves throughout her body, they feel like faint hairline cracks. But at least there’s something there to work with. I won’t have to burn them into her from nothing, which might make it hurt a little less. Probably not much, though. I start pulling power into myself and sending it through my hands into hers, using it to burn the cracks into channels, and it feels a lot like burning patterns into wood, only instead of wood, it’s the being of another person. I try to make them similar to what I think exists in Gavin and Henry—not as deep or as wide as what I figure they’re like in the rest of us.

I know if Alex wasn’t holding her locked in place, she would be screaming and thrashing in pain right now. But I keep going. I told her this is what it would be like, and she still asked for it, so I keep going.

I don’t know how long it’s been, or how much longer it’s going to take. I keep pulling power into myself and using it to burn through her. I feel my own skin growing hot where our hands meet, but I ignore it and continue working. A part of me is distantly aware Lisette has lost consciousness—which is probably a mercy—though Alex still holds her in place. I’m nowhere near done.

So far, I’ve just been pushing power into her, etching the pathways that will allow it to flow. Now I begin pulling it through her, and using it to bind her to me, similar to what I did with the deer. I remold parts of Lisette to be more like myself, and force her body to accept the changes I’m making as I do so. I wrap the changes tighter and tighter so that the only way the power can flow is through her and into me. I layer on more magic, so that if Lisette—or anyone else—tries to use the connection to pull power from me, it’ll result in Lisette’s death. I hope it won’t be necessary, but I’m unwilling to chance it so I put more power into that piece than any other part of what I’ve done to her.

Self preservation is real.

Finally, everything is in place, and I hold it there until it feels like a note being stretched to its breaking point. Then I let it all crystalize and release it. I think I feel reality actively reshaping itself.

I open my eyes and take a breath. Hold it, then begin pulling power through Lisette, and neither of us dies as I do so. That part of the magic, at least, is solid and stable. We’ll have to see what the rest is like when she wakes up. If she wakes up.

“You can let her go, Alex,” I tell him and he catches her as she slumps forward.

I’m not exactly sure how much time has passed, but enough the others have come back from setting snares, and someone built a fire.

My hands are hot, and it feels like I’ve burned them. Damn. Alex notices me looking at them, and grabs them before I can yank them away.

“All good?” Liam asks.

“I don’t know. We’ll find out when she wakes up,” I say as I pull my hands away from Alex and rise to my feet. “Giorgi, can you show me how you set the snares?”

“Sure.”

I follow him as he gets up and walks away. About a hundred yards away he stops and kneels in front of a snare, undoing whatever he did to set it up in the first place. He walks me through the process of setting it up, and then hands it to me. It’s impressively simple for something that caught five rabbits. Merely some wire twisted around itself into a sliding loop, and suspended between two sticks at rabbit level. But once you’re caught in it, it tightens down the more you struggle to get free of it. It feels like a metaphor for my life right now.

“Are the snares the only reason we’re out here?” Giorgi finally asks, once I’ve finished resetting it.

“No, but I did want to see how they work. Where’d you get the wire from?”

“Took it off the ship. Figured it would come in handy.”

I nod. “Can you keep an eye on Lisette for a while? Once she wakes up?”

“Yes. Why?”

“I am… concerned by how desperately she wanted this.”

I don’t bother supplying more detail, and Giorgi doesn’t ask. I’m not sure if that’s because he understands why, or if he doesn’t care, and I don’t care enough to ask, as long as someone has eyes on Lisette.

He nods. “I can do that.”

“Thanks. Do we have any food for tonight?”

“Not much.”

I sigh. There’s a deer not far away, but that would be a waste. “Where are the other snares?”

“There are three more further along this game trail.”

I grab his arm and pull him to the side. I force my awareness out of myself until I find some rabbits, and then I encourage them to come down this trail. A few minutes later, one comes racing down the trail and hits the snare I’ve just reset. It’s going swiftly enough its neck snaps.

“Huh. At least it’s fast,” I say.

“If they hit the snare quickly enough,” Giorgi says with a nod.

“Let’s go get the others.”

His eyebrows lift slightly in surprise. “Are you going to explain how you did that?”

“There are at least seven deer within a mile of us. Can you feel them?”

He shakes his head.

“Figure out how to feel them first, and then I’ll explain.”

“How do I do that?”

“It’s like… if you had eyes and ears all over. You make all of your senses bigger until you can feel where the deer are, almost like if you could see them in the distance. It’s hard to explain. I think you kind of just have to work it out.”

He nods.

We go get the remaining rabbits, resetting the snares as we do. When we walk back to the others, Gavin and Henry look mildly surprised, but they’re the only ones.

I leave the butchering and cooking of the rabbits to whomever’s willing to do it, and go lean up against Liam who wraps an arm around me. We need tents and some gods damned privacy, but it doesn’t seem like we’re going to have any of that for the next couple of weeks. I sigh.

“Are you okay?” Liam murmurs.

“I don’t know,” I answer softly. “I want to go throw rocks at shit,” I admit. But like the tents, there are no bottles to throw rocks at. There aren’t even any rocks, unless I want to waste energy digging them out of the dirt.

There’s not much to say to that, so Liam simply nods, and we sit around the fire in silence. I would just as soon keep walking until we get to Branton, even if expending the energy to do so would be stupid. The fact the others can’t is the only thing really stopping me.

### 11 - Pepper

The next morning Lisette doesn’t wake up. She’s breathing and her pulse is fine, so I’m not too concerned about it. I’m merely annoyed. We can’t afford to lose an entire day, or however long it’s going to take, waiting for her to wake up.

“We’re going to have to carry her,” I tell the others.

“Over this terrain?” Henry asks uncertainly.

“Yeah. Liam, Peter, Alex, you guys are the biggest. What do you have for extra clothes?” I question.

“Not much,” Peter says, pulling out a spare shirt and pair of pants.

“Hand them over,” I tell him, and wait for Alex and Liam to do the same. Once I’ve got all their spare clothes, I begin knotting them together into something resembling a sling.

Alex sighs. “Well there’s no way I’m going to be able to wear those again, Hazel.”

I shrug. “If you have a better idea about how to carry her for the next twenty five miles, I’m all ears.”

“I don’t know. How about a litter?”

“Made from what? Green wood? It’d probably be close to half again her weight, and we’d still need something to lash it together.”

“Fine. Whatever,” he grumbles because he knows I’m right.

Once I’ve got something I think will hold her, I say, “We’ll pair off by height. Me and Davy. Henry and Giorgi. Gavin and Alex. Peter and Liam. A mile at a time, then switch?”

Everyone nods in agreement.

“Okay, help me get her into this thing.”

Eventually Davy and I are standing, holding the knotted ends of the sling at our shoulders, with Lisette slumped suspended between us in something like a seated position.

“Are you guys sure you can manage that?” Gavin asks skeptically.

“Better than you,” I tell him with a snort. “Let’s go.”

----

By the end of the day, we’ve all had at least six turns carrying Lisette, and I can tell everyone is sick of it, but no one is complaining, even though it took us an extra three hours to cover the same distance today as we did yesterday.

“I’ll go see about some food,” Giorgi says, his brown eyes finding mine when we finally decide on a stopping point.

I look back in question, and he shrugs.

“Let us know if you need some help,” I tell him. I guess we’ll see what happens.

He nods and goes off into the brush.

“What are you teaching my brother?” Gavin asks curiously.

“How to stay alive. Hopefully,” I mutter as I slump back onto my pack and stare up at the sky. Everyday we’re not in Branton feels like a missed opportunity, an advantage that we’re giving away.

After what feels like twenty minutes or so, Giorgi comes back with two rabbits. Not half bad for a first attempt.

Liam drops to sit next to me, and I immediately move a little bit closer and interlace my fingers with his. Everyone’s exhausted, so we all sit silently while Alex builds a fire and Davy and Henry set about butchering the rabbits.

“So how much longer are we going to carry her?” Gavin asks, nodding at Lisette.

“I have no idea. If we’re lucky, she’ll wake up tomorrow,” I answer.

“So you’re saying we’ll definitely be carrying her tomorrow,” Gavin says.

I look at him in question.

“When are we ever that lucky?”

I sigh. “You’re probably right.”

----

In the evening two days later, after another fifty miles of carrying her across the scrubland, Lisette finally wakes up.

“What happened?” she asks groggily.

“You’ve been unconscious for about three days,” Gavin says. “We’ve been *carrying* you for three days.”

I grin. You can always count on Gavin to relay the most important information first. I’ll give him that.

“Oh,” Lisette says, looking somewhat abashed. “Did it work?” she asks, looking at me.

“I have no idea,” I tell her. “You’re not dead,” I shrug. “Beyond that, I don’t know. Even if it did, you’re still going to have to figure out how it works. Start with the knot again.”

“Start with walking again,” Gavin mutters, and I can’t help but laugh. I’m as sick of carrying her as everyone else.

Davy appears and hands her a waterskin and some food. Acting like a real person instead of like Gavin and me, who I guess expected her to get up and get it herself. She quickly drains the waterskin. A few days of unconsciousness will do that to a person.

After she eats what Davy handed her, she quickly begins messing with the fabric knot, doing nothing to quell my unease. While the learning experience was worthwhile, and perhaps even necessary, I am increasingly feeling like I will live to regret this. But at the same time, I think had I not done it, Lisette would have found a way to make me regret that as well. Damned if I did and damned if I didn’t. Story of my life.

I get up and go to find Liam. He’s next to the stream we’ve stopped by for the night, with Alex and Peter. I think Liam and Peter are trying to work out how to catch some fish, and I think Alex is only there to laugh at them, which fair. And since I would sooner go hungry than eat fish, I’m not going to volunteer any tips either.

“Hey Liam, walk with me a bit?” I say as I approach them, extending my hand to him.

He nods and steps away from the stream.

“What’s up?” he asks once we’ve moved out of earshot of the others.

“Can’t I just want a little alone time with you?” I ask in response.

He stops moving forward and spins me around to face him, catching my other hand in his, before bringing his mouth to meet mine. My lips eagerly part beneath his, and as his tongue strokes over mine I press myself more firmly against him and he releases my hands, sliding his to my waist. Mine immediately wrap around him to pull him closer to me. His hands move down to my hips and then over my ass, before he lifts me up, and I wrap my legs around him. I can feel the heat coming off of him as I slip my tongue into his mouth, deepening our kiss. I manage to work my hands under his shirt when he gently pulls back, panting.

“This isn’t what you had on your mind when you asked me to walk with you,” he says.

“Well it’s damn sure what I have on my mind now,” I say kissing him again, my own breathing sounding equally as ragged.

He pulls back again though, and I’m forced to say, “This now. Talking later. Please, Liam. Please,” I repeat again, beseechingly, when he doesn’t move.

Finally, his mouth is on mine again, as hungry for me as I am for him. His hand slips beneath my shirt to the small of my back, and I moan softly, bringing a new urgency to his movements. He sets me down so he can pull off my shirt, and I strip off his clothes exactly as quickly. His teeth find my nipple and gently tease it. I wind one hand through his hair to keep me balanced and on my feet and wrap my other around his dick. He gasps as he brings his mouth back to mine. After a moment, I pull away and skim my lips over his jaw, before moving down his neck to his chest. I let my tongue trace over the ridges of his ribs, and the muscles of his stomach as I drop to my knees, and take the head of his penis into my mouth, moving my tongue over him languidly. The sound he makes as his hands tangle in my hair is enough to make me never want to stop, and I suck him deeper into my mouth, working my tongue along the length of him. I continue, as his breathing becomes rougher and rougher. In one quick motion, he pulls me from my knees, lifting me into the air and turning us around so my back is against the nearest tree, as he slides into me.

I find his mouth with my own to keep from shouting out in pleasure because there’s nothing shielding the sound, and we’re not that far from everyone else. But I definitely don’t have the ability to do anything about it right now. Liam is the only thing I can focus on as he thrusts into me again and again.

I’m nearly there when he drops a hand to trace across my clit as he continues to drive into me. It’s enough to push me over the edge, and I lock my legs around him holding him tight to me as I convulse around him, which is enough to pull him over with me.

He holds me against the tree for a few minutes as we both catch our breath and come down from the high. Eventually, he slowly lowers me to my feet, and I immediately miss his body pinning mine in place.

“Let’s stay here for a while,” I whisper.

“Okay,” he agrees, moving our clothes so we can lie on top of them before he pulls me to his chest. “So what did you want to talk about?” he asks after a few minutes.

“Hmm?”

“Before,” he says. “When you came to find me. What did you want to talk about?”

“Oh.” I sigh. “Lisette. We can’t take her to the flat, Liam.”

“Why not? Is something wrong?”

“I’m not… I don’t know. She woke up, and she seems fine but…” I trail off.

“But?”

“She wants it all too much,” I say softly. “It’s not normal. It makes me really, really uneasy. And maybe it will be fine and nothing will come of it, but…”

“But you don’t think so. Okay,” he says, running his hand along my spine. “We’ll figure out something else. We’ve got time.”

“Okay, good.” I close my eyes and enjoy the moment. It’s the first one we’ve had alone in days, and I had no idea how much I needed it. “I love you. Let’s stay here forever,” I murmur.

“I love you too, but you would get bored,” Liam tells me.

“I think you could help with that.”

We lie there together until I hear Alex shouting, “Hazel! Liam! Don’t make me come find you!”

I sigh. “We’d better go back. He’ll definitely make good on that threat if we don’t.”

We stand up and begin to sort out whose clothes are whose, tugging them on as we go.

Finally, we make our way back to the others. When we get there Alex takes one look at us, his eyes shifting between Liam and me. “Gods, this is so weird,” he mutters before walking away.

I look at Liam, and we both shrug.

“Sounds like a you problem,” I call after Alex.

“Never said it wasn’t,” he tosses back over his shoulder.

I look for Lisette, and find her fiddling with the knot, but she’s actually close now, and I can’t help but sigh. I really hope I’m wrong, but I’m pretty sure I’m not.

### 12 - It’s Called Freefall

We spend the next twelve days walking. It’s monotonous, but at least we’re doing something. Lisette peppers me with questions about magic throughout the trek. I don’t think I’ve ever spent so much time talking about it in my life. To say she’s infatuated would be understating the matter.

I’m doing my best to remain detached from the whole thing. Either she’s going to get herself killed, I’m going to kill her, or everything will work itself out. There’s no reason to dwell on it, now that I’ve established the basic parameters of the situation. Alex and Davy both know the situation, and I’m pretty sure Giorgi’s worked it out as well. I’m not sure about the others, but if they haven’t, they haven’t been paying attention.

“So what did you do to get us through the pass?” Lisette asks, and I feel all eyes except Davy’s, Alex’s, and Liam’s turn to me.

“Magic,” I answer, hoping it will be enough and knowing it won’t.

“Yes, but what? And how?”

I consider my words carefully. There’s no good answer to this question. If I tell her what I did, she’s going to start trying to work it out herself. If I tell her it’s nothing she’s going to be able to replicate, she’s not going to believe me, and I’m pretty sure she’ll resent both me and the implications, and start trying to work it out herself.

“It’s nothing I want to explain to anyone who doesn’t already know the details,” I tell her in a tone that should make it clear I’m unwilling to discuss it.

“But—”

“No, Lisette. There are no buts. It’s an off limits topic of conversation.”

“But—”

“Lisette, she said no,” Henry chides. “Drop it. You’re alive. That should be good enough.”

“But—”

“Lisette, shut the hell up.” This comes from Gavin, who goes on to say, “Everyone is sick of listening to you bug Hazel about magic. Her most of all, I’m sure,” he mutters.

“Wait, really?” she asks.

“Yes. Notice how you’re the *only* one talking about it?” Gavin questions.

“Oh.”

We walk in silence for a while after that, and eventually Alex moves next to me, and then begins falling back slightly, so I shorten my stride to match his until we’re trailing behind the others by several yards. After a few more minutes, I feel his magic wrap around us both.

“She’s still thinking about it,” he tells me softly. “All the time. All I’ve felt coming from her since she woke up is the desire for magic.”

I nod. It’s about what I expected. “I’m not surprised,” I eventually say. “What do you think the chances are she’s able to figure out how to manage it?”

“Not high,” he says. After thinking about it for a minute, he goes on to add, “Maybe twenty percent. Probably less.”

“Yeah.”

“So what are you going to do?”

“Wait and see?” I shrug.

“Might not be the best course of action.”

“Maybe, but what’s the alternative?”

“Stop the problem, that we all know is going to be a problem, before it can become a problem?”

“Be my guest,” I tell him, “but unless you’re willing to do it, I’m going to give her a chance.”

“I might.”

I shrug. I’d be lying if I said the thought hadn’t crossed my mind as well.

“A slip and fall down a ravine here might be safer than letting her back into a city full of people.”

“I’m aware. Listen, I’m not going to stop you. But I’m also not going to kill her on a maybe. We’d both be dead a hundred times over if that’s the standard we’re using.”

He sighs, but lets his magic fall away, and we begin catching back up to the others.

----

“What was that about earlier?” Liam inquires that evening, when we’re alone.

“What?”

“The hushed conversation you and Alex were having.”

“Oh. That.” I sigh. “He’s concerned about Lisette.”

“He’s concerned. You’re concerned. I assume Davy is also concerned?”

“Yes.”

“Should I be concerned?” he asks.

“Probably,” I mutter, avoiding his eyes.

“How concerned?”

I debate not answering. I consider not quite lying. Ultimately I decide to admit where things stand. “Pretty concerned. Alex thinks we’d be smart to kill her now, rather than risk her in a city full of people.”

“Shit.”

“Yeah.”

“And what’s your take?”

“My vote is to give her enough rope to either hang herself, or figure out how to climb back up. But I told Alex if he disagrees, I won’t stop him. For now, I think he’s willing to wait and see.” I’m quiet for a minute, before finally saying, “People like her are the reason everyone is scared of people like us. Right now, I don’t think there’s anything she wouldn’t do for a little bit more power, and I mean *just* for the sake of more power.”

----

The next day, we begin to see signs of habitation again. There are small farmsteads and streams of smoke rising from chimneys in the distance. Halfway through the day, we could journey by actual road if we desired, but I’m unwilling to chance it. Based on where we got off the ship, this is the only logical direction we would come from, so if someone is looking for us, that road is the one they would be watching. I don’t know if anyone is, but I feel like we’d be idiots to assume they aren’t.

“No magic,” I tell the others. “At least not until we’re back in Branton. There’s a chance they could use it to find us,” I add, thinking about how Liam’s magic works. I’m pretty sure I could do it if I tried.

I get nods of acknowledgment from everyone but Lisette. “Lisette?”

“Yeah. Okay. Fine.”

I look at Giorgi only to find him already watching me. He nods.

We both keep a close eye on Lisette for the rest of the day, and the more I watch her, the more certain I become: she’s going to run tonight. If she does, I can’t let her go back to Branton. It’ll be the deciding factor.

She didn’t like it when I called for a moratorium on magic, the same as she didn’t like it when I wouldn’t answer her questions about the pass. She wants to do what she wants to do, and everyone else be damned, and that’s the single most dangerous attitude for her to have. Not necessarily for herself, but for everyone around her.

When we stop for the night, I make sure to pick a spot close to Lisette, and I see Giorgi, Alex, and Davy have done the same. Apparently, we’re all expecting her to run tonight.

After a bit, Giorgi and Davy both disappear into the woodlands, and Alex and I stay near Lisette.

“So, what’s everyone looking forward to when we get back?” I ask in an attempt to distract Lisette from her own stupidity.

“Beds,” Henry says wistfully.

“Beds are nice,” Peter remarks, “but I’ll be happy not to spend everyday walking from sunup until sundown.”

“Eating something besides rabbit. If I never eat rabbit again, it’ll be too soon,” Gavin comments.

“You’re not wrong about that,” Alex notes, nodding in agreement.

“Lisette? What about you?” I probe.

“I don’t know,” she mumbles, clearly distracted.

I hear Alex sigh.

“What about you, Hazel?” Peter asks.

“It’s a tie between privacy and churros,” I say, glancing toward Liam. “I can feel you rolling your eyes, Alex.”

“Yeah, I’ve got to go with privacy,” Liam agrees.

----

It’s close to two in the morning when Lisette finally makes her move, slinging her pack over her shoulder and creeping away from the rest of us. Once she’s got a bit of a lead on me, I get up and follow her.

“Going somewhere, Lisette?” I ask, once we’re several hundred feet away from the others. I know Giorgi and Davy are out here somewhere, and I assume Alex is somewhere behind me.

She jerks to a stop, clearly not having realized I was following her. She lets her pack fall from her shoulder as she turns to face me.

“Back to Branton,” she states.

“Well, that’s good. Since we’re all going there, we can keep going together.”

“No, I can’t. I need to go now.”

“Why?” I pry.

“I just do.”

“The magic?”

“I just need to.”

“I can’t let you, Lisette. I really wish I could but I can’t. Do you understand how dangerous you are right now? The magic has been the only thing you’ve been thinking about since you woke up. Even before that, probably. Am I right?” I’m pretty sure I’m right.

“Yes,” she admits.

“Come back and we’ll try to figure something else out.” I honestly don’t even have the faintest idea of what ‘something else’ could be, but I *will* try to figure it out if she comes back. I know she won’t though.

“No,” she confirms for me, shaking her head.

“I can’t let you go on your own, Lisette,” I reiterate.

Taking the statement for what it is, she starts toward me. Lisette has seven or eight inches on me, and probably a solid sixty pounds. Maybe more. So there’s no hesitation on my part when I draw a knife from its sheath. I could kill her in a second with magic, but when I told the others no magic, I meant it. I send my right arm back and release the stone I’ve had cupped in my palm throughout the conversation at her head. It hits her right above her left eyebrow, splitting the skin and sending blood streaming into her left eye.

I draw a second knife and close the distance between us. I duck under her arms as I get close and send a knife into her ribs. Unfortunately, it hits bone and skates along, leaving a nasty gash that’s definitely not life threatening. I kick out at her right knee as I move past. I hear a popping crunch that sounds like it’s done some damage as I make contact. When I come up though, her right fist slams into my left cheekbone, sending me staggering back a couple of steps before I’m able to rebalance and slide to the side. My head is ringing, and I think the skin on my cheek is split open. But at least whatever blood is coming from the cut is flowing down my face and not into my eyes. I move to Lisette’s left, trying for whatever advantage the blood clouding her vision can give me, and sink a knife into her left side.

I feel her begin to pull energy into herself. I was hoping to end this before she had a chance to use any magic. I twist the knife as I move, then yank it out as I slip around behind her. Once behind her, I drive both knives into her throat from opposite sides, and release them as she falls to her knees, with blood pulsing darkly from the wounds around each knife.

“Fuck,” I mutter softly as I remove the knives and the pulsing blood ebbs to a slow trickle. I wait until I’m reasonably sure she’s gone, and then I plunge a knife into her heart for good measure. I’ve survived wounds I shouldn’t have been able to before, so I see no reason to chance her doing the same, however unlikely it may be.

I wrap my fingers around her wrist searching for a pulse. When I’ve counted to two hundred without feeling one. I wipe my knives off on her clothes as best I can before sheathing them and rising to my feet.

I see Davy and Giorgi approaching from the south and turn to find Alex coming from the north. Fuck.

Alex makes it to me first and starts to reach for my face.

“Don’t touch me,” I bark sharply, and he snatches his hand back.

He tears a piece of cloth from his shirt and hands it to me instead. “It might scar,” he tells me as I press it to my face.

“Yeah, well. It would serve me right,” I mutter darkly.

“For which part? Letting her punch you in the face, or letting her have magic in the first place?” he asks as Davy and Giorgi reach us.

“All of it,” I answer grimly. I’m pissed. “Let’s go back. We all need to move. She started pulling power into her. If anyone was looking for us, she might have given our position away.”

“What do you want to do with her?” he asks.

“Leave her. We don’t have time. We need to start circling around, and change the direction we’re approaching from.”

“Alright. We’ll sort the others,” Alex says, and Davy and Giorgi nod in agreement.

“Fine,” I say, pressing the cloth into my face a little bit harder. It stings. Serves me gods damned right.

### 13 - The Monster

I’m the last one back up the hill to where the others are sleeping. By the time I get there, Alex has woken everyone up, and Davy is barking out instructions. I stand there silently wondering how much blood is visible on my clothing right now. It probably doesn’t matter because I’m sure the streaks on my face are pretty clear. I wish I could get Lisette’s blood off me, but I meant it when I said no magic.

Alex comes over carrying a waterskin, his dark hair seeming to absorb the light. “Hands out,” he orders.

I don’t argue, simply hold them in front of me and allow him to pour water over them as I do my best to scrub off the blood.

Fuck.

I notice Davy in the background, now talking to Liam as Liam watches me. I close my eyes. Fuck.

“It’s fine, sis.”

It is not fine. Least fine is the fact that except for this last bit, I’d do it all again, because Davy was right. The only thing I would change, retrospectively, would be to slit her throat before she ever woke up. It is so fucking far from fine it’s laughable. I resist the urge though, because I’m pretty sure the last thing everyone else needs is to see me standing here, covered in Lisette’s blood, laughing. Fuck.

I open my eyes back up. Davy is still talking to Liam. I have no idea what he’s saying, and I can’t quite make myself care right now.

“Alex, we need to move.”

“I know. Another minute isn’t going to hurt anything, Hazel. We don’t know if anyone is coming, but even if they are, we’ll be gone before they get here.”

“They’re coming,” I tell him.

His eyes flick to mine and see the urgency there.

“Okay,” he says, shoving my pack into my arms. “Everyone up,” he calls out to the others. “We’re going now. No magic and everyone is running.”

I let out a sigh of relief, which quickly dies when I hear someone, I think Henry, ask, “Where’s Lisette?”

“She decided to leave,” someone, maybe me, answers.

----

We’ve been running for over an hour when someone asks if we can stop. I apparently didn’t hear the question the first time it was asked.

“Hazel,” Alex says, getting my attention, “do we need to keep running?”

“Yes.”

I’m to the far right of the group. Alex is to my left, and Davy is just ahead of him, and Giorgi is just behind. I think they’re keeping the others away from me. I’m not sure, and I don’t really care. No one has been talking to me, and that’s good enough.

Alex asks the same question again an hour later, and this time I agree we can slow to a walk. Whatever’s behind us no longer feels quite so imminently threatening.

Sometime later, when the sky has begun to lighten, Liam evidently decides enough time has passed and starts to move toward me. Alex, Davy, and even Giorgi all block him out, each of them silently looking to me to decide if I’m ready to deal with him. Finally I notice and nod, and they fall away slightly as Liam edges closer.

“I don’t want to talk about it,” I tell him before he has a chance to ask any questions.

“Okay,” he agrees, walking next to me in silence.

We cover the miles throughout the day rapidly, and when we’re within ten or fifteen miles of the city proper, Davy calls a halt, and spends a few minutes talking with Liam and Peter. Alex stays near me. Giorgi is talking to Gavin and Henry. I think he’s trying to keep them from asking me questions which, if so, I appreciate. I’m going to have to thank him later. It’s bound to be awkward. I sigh.

“You know Liam wants to talk to you,” Alex comments softly.

“Yeah.”

“Are you going to let him?”

I shrug. “I don’t want to talk about it.”

“I didn’t say he wants to talk about it,” Alex responds. “I said he wants to talk *to* you, sis. There’s a difference.”

“Is there? I can’t imagine what else he would want to talk about.”

Alex sighs, and it somehow feels reproachful. I don’t care.

“I want a bath,” I tell him.

“Yeah. I think Davy’s working on that.”

“Good.” It actually sounds like the best news I’ve heard all month.

Eventually Davy and Peter head off, and Liam comes back toward Alex and me. As soon as he sits down, Alex gets up and leaves. Great.

“How’s your face?” Liam finally asks after several minutes.

“Fine. It hurts. But I’ll live.” It’s more than I can say for Lisette. I sigh.

“Is any of the blood on your clothes yours?”

I look down at myself. You can clearly see the rust colored splotches staining my clothes in the daylight. Damn.

“Not much.”

“Okay. Good. Are *you* okay?”

“I want a bath,” I repeat, not answering the question.

“Yeah. Okay,” Liam says with a hint of resignation as he reaches out and takes my hands in his.

I want to yank them away. I’m sure Lisette’s blood is still caked under my fingernails and around my cuticles. But I don’t. Instead I focus on locking down the nausea that’s coursing through me and drop my head to rest on my forearms. I am so damn tired. The realization catches me off guard. And there’s nothing I can do about it. Just like there’s nothing I can do about the blood which has long since dried hard and stiff across my clothes and skin.

“Did Davy say how long he was going to be gone?” I ask suddenly.

“No,” Liam responds.

I want to scream.

“Hey, Hazel!” I hear Alex call.

“What?” I grate out.

“You good?”

“No. No, I am not fucking good. I need a damned bath.”

“Here,” Henry says, digging through his pack and pulling out clothes that are cleaner than the ones I’m wearing.

He hands them to Alex who brings them to me. I’m already stripping off everything I’m wearing before Alex is halfway between us. I yank on Henry’s clothes as Alex hands them to me, and I feel marginally better now that I’m not sitting in clothes caked with Lisette’s blood.

“Thanks,” I manage, and I see Henry nod.

“Better?” Alex questions, clearly concerned.

I nod. “A bit, yeah.”

“Okay. I know it sucks, but I need you to sit here, be calm, and keep your shit together, Hazel,” he tells me.

“I know,” I say quietly.

“Liam, talk *to* her,” Alex orders. “Tell her about… I don’t know. Your first kiss,” Alex says, waving distractedly.

“Oh,” Gavin says. “Lucy Davis.”

“Shut up, Gavin,” Liam warns him.

“No, this is good,” Alex interjects. “Keep talking, Gavin.”

Gavin smirks as he makes his way toward us. “You were what? Fifteen?” Gavin asks, waiting for Liam to respond, but Liam simply sighs, so Gavin continues. “Anyway, she was a neighborhood girl who lived near him, and he’d had a crush on her since he came to Branton. For four years, he mooned over Lucy Davis.

“Lucy Davis, who was a bit of a… How would you describe her, Giorgi?”

“Bitch,” Giorgi supplies succinctly.

“Yeah. That. But it didn’t matter. Liam was *completely* infatuated with her. Anyway, he walks her home one evening, and they get to the top of the steps in front of her door, and Liam finally decides to make a move, and kiss her. When he does, she shoves him, and he goes flying down the steps and cracks his head on the flagstones below. Giorgi and I had to carry him home, blood pouring from the back of his head.

“When we got back, his grandma assumed it was our fault, that we’d done something which ended up getting him hurt. He had to explain that it wasn’t us, it was *Lucy*, which of course meant he had to explain the details because she wasn’t going to leave it alone at that,” Gavin remembers, laughing.

“Tell her the rest,” Giorgi says.

“Please don’t,” Liam contradicts.

Gavin looks between Liam and Giorgi for a moment, when Giorgi repeats, “Tell her.”

“The next day,” Gavin continues, evidently having decided to listen to Giorgi, “Liam, being Liam, goes around to *apologize* to Lucy. And Lucy not only tells him she’s not interested in him, but that she was never interested in him, and was just hanging around Liam because it meant she got to hang around us.”

“Around Gavin,” Giorgi clarifies.

“Ah,” I say at the same time, I hear Alex mutter, “Ouch,” from a few feet away.

“Thanks,” Liam snaps, clearly annoyed. “Definitely appreciate reliving that.”

“Hazel, are you feeling better or worse than you were ten minutes ago?” Alex asks.

“Better,” I admit.

“Fine,” Liam grumbles as Alex stares at him.

“First kisses are never good,” I tell Liam.

“Not usually that bad though,” Giorgi remarks, continuing to rib Liam.

----

About an hour later Peter comes back without Davy. Somehow, Davy managed to get rooms at an inn a couple of miles away. Peter takes us there. I’m not sure where Davy has gone. Alex has been talking to Peter so he probably knows.

Eventually, Alex comes and speaks to Liam. I ignore them both. Unless they’re discussing the logistics of baths, I don’t care. And the logistics of baths are that I get a bath, and if there’s a limited number of baths to be had, I get a bath *first*. I don’t think anyone will argue with me. Once again, the thought has me wanting to burst out laughing, and once again, I suppress the urge because I’m pretty sure there are rules somewhere. And the rules probably state that there’s at least a twenty four hour moratorium on laughter after your hands have been covered in someone else’s blood.

The next time I focus on my surroundings instead of my internal dialog, we’re walking up a staircase. Alex and Liam are still talking. Or talking again? Who knows.

A door opens, and Liam’s hand is on my back, pushing me through it. Mercifully, there’s a tub full of water already in the room.

“Davy had them bring the water,” Liam tells me after the door shuts as I’m stripping off my clothes and stepping into it.

The water is only slightly warmer than room temperature, but I don’t care.

“Davy will be back soon with new clothes, and Alex is going to bring some food.”

“Okay,” I acknowledge and then I sink below the water.

I count to a hundred. I consider the merits of trying for another hundred before coming up for air, but that would probably be stupid. The water runs down my face stinging the cut on my cheek as I break the surface and take a breath.

What a fucking disaster.

I must have said it out loud because Liam is saying, “Yeah, it’s not great.”

“Shit. She was your friend,” I mutter. Liam’s friend, and Henry’s. Gavin’s, Giorgi’s… She was everyone’s friend.

“She was your friend too,” Liam reminds me, as I sink back beneath the water and finally let out the scream I’ve been repressing for the last several hours.

I begin the process of incorporating this new knowledge into what I know about myself, and it is not going well for me. Liam finally reaches into the tub and pulls me up. Apparently, he was counting too.

“For what it’s worth,” he says, “you made the least bad decision.”

I nod, because I know it’s true. I’ve known it was true for days, and somehow I like it even less now than I did three days ago.

“Alex brought food. Get out of the tub and eat something,” Liam tells me, handing me a towel.

Halfway through eating what Liam has handed me, a knock comes on the door. Liam gets up and answers it. He talks for a minute, takes something and closes the door.

“Here, new clothes.”

Once I’ve finished eating and have dressed, Liam opens the door again. Davy comes in.

“Davy’s going to hang out here with you while I go get cleaned up,” Liam states.

I roll my eyes. “I’m fine.”

“I know, but Davy wants to talk to you.”

“Whatever,” I huff. “You should keep the beard,” I tell Liam, as he walks out the door.

“Thanks for the bath. And the clothes,” I say to Davy once the door has latched shut.

He nods. “You could have let Lisette get to Giorgi or me.”

“I know, but she was my mess.”

“She was as much my mess as yours,” Davy replies.

“Maybe,” I shrug. “Maybe not.”

“You were right,” Davy comments.

“About what?”

“They’re looking for us.”

“Yeah, I know.”

“How?”

“It’s the most logical course of action. It’s what I would do,” I shrug.

“Okay,” Davy stands. “Be nice to Liam,” he tells me as he moves to the door. “He’s worried about you.”

“When am I ever not nice to Liam?”

Davy laughs.

“Piss off, Davy,” I tell him as he leaves the room.

### 14 - Ninety-Nine Problems

I lie in bed, curled next to Liam for what feels like hours, before finally giving up. Luckily, a defining characteristic of buildings everywhere is rooftops. I open the window and am able to stand on the sill and reach the eaves of the rooftop just enough to be able to pull myself up and over the edge. Definitely not the easiest maneuver, but I manage it.

The night air is cool, with the last hints of winter giving way to spring. It’s quiet. I lie back on the roof and stare up at the stars. I’m dreading tomorrow. My mother probably arrived in Branton at least two weeks ago, and who knows what she’s been doing since. It’s almost guaranteed Iverson knows about me, and knows she’s back, meaning both of them are going to be looking for me. Her return is probably also going to accelerate Dairuvar’s overall aggression toward the other polities, making war virtually a foregone conclusion. Add the fucking war college to that, who will definitely be looking for Liam, Henry and me—both on behalf of themselves, but likely also at General Iverson’s behest—and it’s going to be a nightmare.

I wish there was someone else like me. We need to test out exactly how well and how precisely magic can be sensed, especially in a crowded area like a city, but we basically need two of me to do it, and the closest we have is a combination of me and Alex, and me and Liam. Even conducting the test has risks—mostly that someone figures out where we are, which would be… bad. Very, very bad. Until we have some idea of what’s going to get us caught, all magic needs to be done with the lightest of touches, and even that will still be akin to playing with fire.

So yeah. We’ll only be hunted by two polities and the Army of the Allied Polities’ War College. And if they find out that I killed Lisette… Or *why* I killed Lisette.

I am so fucked.

I hear a scuff on the roof behind me, and assume it’s Alex or Davy, until Liam sits down next to me and I do a double take.

“What are you doing up here?” I ask.

“You’re up here.”

“Yeah, but… How did you get up here?”

“Probably the same way you did. From the window,” he tells me.

“*You* climbed out the window?”

Liam nods.

“I promise I’m okay. You don’t have to sit up here with me.”

“I know. Do you want me to leave?” he inquires quietly, and I hear more than a hint of vulnerability in the question.

“No,” I answer honestly. “I want you to stay, but only if you’re actually okay being up here.”

He interlaces his fingers with mine in response. “What are you thinking about?”

I sigh. “There are so many problems, and I don’t see any good solutions. Dairuvar is going to be hunting me. My mother is going to be hunting me. The war college is going to be hunting for all of us, and if they find out about Lisette—”

“They won’t.”

“They might. If they do, that would be equally as bad. My mother and Iverson are going to start a war. It feels like I’m the fulcrum it’s all balanced on.”

“Hazel,” Liam scoffs.

“What?”

“Dairuvar was *always* going to start a war. That doesn’t have anything to do with you. It barely even has anything to do with Alexandria.”

I sigh, but he has a point.

“But yes, your mother, Iverson, and the war college are problems, though possibly not insurmountable ones.”

“How do you figure? Unless I kill both of them, and probably Christine too, I don’t see a solution.”

“Give me a couple days. In the meantime, I doubt the war college will have any idea we’re back. I don’t think Iverson will tell them. As far as they’re concerned, we’ll be somewhere in the mountains. When it comes time to tell them anything, we’ll tell them Lisette died in the pass.”

“What about Amelia?” I ask. “She’ll have been back for a couple of weeks, and she knows Lisette didn’t die in the pass.”

“Yeah, she’s the biggest possible snag. If we’re lucky, she’ll still be with your mother and Michael. Her family wanted them both to learn magic, so there’s a good chance she’s still with them.”

“Then what? We abduct her? Lure her away somehow? How? I can’t do it, you definitely can’t do it. Alex and Davy are out of the question too.”

“Peter,” he says simply.

“She hates Peter.”

“She’s impulsive. He can probably get her away from your mother one way or another. And he’s apparently good at memories.”

“And you’re good at suggestions,” I mutter. “It could work. Maybe. If we’re really, really lucky.” I don’t think we’re that lucky, but I don’t say it out loud. Who knows, maybe after the terrible run of luck it feels like I’ve had lately…

“It’s a whole lot of maybes, Liam.”

“Well, if it doesn’t work, I guess we can go back to considering whether or not we want to kill off half the ruling families.”

I can’t tell if he’s serious or not, but I think he might be.

“Okay.” I lean my head against his shoulder. “Are you going to be able to get back down or do I need to find a ladder?”

“I’ll figure it out,” he tells me, but sounds a little uncertain as he says it.

----

The next morning over breakfast Liam explains the situation with Amelia to Peter. Of course Peter understands right away why we need to talk with her.

“She might not want to come,” Peter states.

“Yeah, that’s what I said.”

“You’ll figure it out,” Liam responds.

Peter sighs. “I’m taking Gavin and Giorgi.”

Liam nods.

“Do you think Davy could find us some horses?” Peter asks me. He’s clearly trying to get rid of me, since he could go ask Davy himself, but I’ll play along.

“I’ll go ask him,” I say as I stand up and leave the two of them alone.

I head up the stairs only to realize I have no idea what room anyone else is in. I knock on the door across the hall from ours hoping for the best. Gavin answers.

“Hey Gavin, do you know which room Davy is in?”

“Next door,” he tells me.

“Thanks. Peter and Liam are downstairs. I think they want to talk to you and Giorgi,” I let him know, as I head to the next door.

Davy opens the door right as I reach it and lift my hand to knock.

“Congratulations,” he says looking at me. “You look like a person again today.”

“Yeah, well.” I shrug. “New day, new me, new problems. Peter wants to know if you can figure out how to acquire a few horses.”

“You’re running errands for Peter, now?” Davy questions skeptically.

“I’m being nice to Liam.”

Davy rolls his eyes.

“Liam has a plan. Peter is helping,” I explain.

“A plan?”

“Yeah, to make it so that we’re not—so that I’m not—being hunted by the war college, Iverson, and my mother simultaneously. You’ll have to talk to him about the finer details, but right now, Peter wants three horses.”

“When?” Davy asks.

“Now, probably.”

“I’m not a miracle worker,” Davy sighs. “I’ll go talk to him.”

I follow along because I’ve got nothing better going on.

## Part 2

### 15 - It Wasn’t Me/Anti-Hero

We enter the city on foot without Peter, Giorgi, or Gavin. Even though this puts us in closer physical proximity to all of the people and things I’m most concerned about, I feel better.

Apparently at some point over the last five years, and I couldn’t even say when it happened, I started to actually consider Branton my home, and not just the place I’m currently living. I think it helps that it’s one of the places I never lived, or even visited, as a child. I don’t have a whole host of negative memories associated with it. There’s also the fact that it, like Corriven, is not the territory of any polity. It simultaneously belongs to all of them and none of them. It is, effectively, a free city-state.

The war college is similar. Each polity has its own standing army—collectively referred to as the armies of the Allied Polities—and then there is the Army of the Allied Polities. When there is an external threat, the armies of the Allied Polities fall under the command of the Army of the Allied Polities so that it acts as one cohesive force. After the threat has been addressed, the armies of the Allied Polities return to their individual polity’s command. This allows the Army of the Allied Polities to expand and contract as needed, while possessing the ability to have a trained military force during times which call for rapid expansion. However, this really only works for external threats, hence, the term ‘allied.’ If you have an internal threat, you still end up with what is functionally a civil war. And Dairuvar no longer wants an alliance. They want an empire.

However, despite General Iverson having assumed the role of commanding General of the Army of the Allied Polities—something which never should have been permitted, as far as any reasonable thinking person is concerned, since he’s also the ruler of Dairuvar polity—the Army of the Allied Polities doesn’t maintain standing forces in individual polities, and according to a variety of treaties and other legal documents, it *can’t*. Effectively, this means that as long as I am officially a student of the war college or a member of the Army of the Allied Polities, neither General Iverson nor my mother can legally force me to Dairuvar. It’s a small protection, but it *is* a protection. That’s assuming I can go back to the war college, and they don’t end up hunting me as well.

There are, however, some hiccups to this plan. Amelia is one. I’m the other. Or at least my historical decisions are. To be fair, I only learned the finer details surrounding Liam’s plan, and the legalities related to the Army of the Allied Polities this morning. On our walk here. To this pub. Where we’re currently sitting. And I’m trying to figure out how to broach the topic of why I wasn’t already aware of said legalities.

Davy knows. Davy has been side-eyeing me since the second he heard the broad strokes of what Liam has planned. If Alex had spent half a second thinking about it, he probably would have figured it out and told Liam outright about the flaw in his plan. The flaw also known as Hazel Raidane, the person to whom rules are more of a suggestion of things you *should* do, under *ideal* circumstances, rather than things you *must* do, under *all* circumstances.

I’ve been sitting at the table, tapping the side of my half full glass of beer for a solid ten minutes, trying to figure out the best way to say it when Peter, Gavin, and Giorgi walk in and wedge themselves around our table, and call for three more beers.

“Amelia and Michael are still with Alexandria,” Peter confirms.

“Well, that’s good news,” Liam says grinning.

I accelerate the rate at which I’m tapping my glass slightly and Davy props an elbow on the table and leans his chin on his fist, staring at me. I note his stare, and sigh.

“What’s up with you two?” Gavin inquires, looking between me and Davy.

“I don’t know, Hazel,” Davy snarks, “what’s up with us?”

I sigh again. Once definitely wasn’t enough.

“There, uh, may be something I have neglected to mention.”

“Do go on, cousin. Tell everyone what you have neglected to mention,” Davy states flatly, clearly annoyed with me. In his defense, he did tell me. And I didn’t listen. I believe my exact words may have been, ‘It’ll be *fine*. No one *ever* checks these things.’ Knowing me, I probably even waved my hand airily.

“Fine, you were right, Davy. I was wrong.” Best to start with that. “So. Um. Most of what you said this morning was news to me, Liam.”

“What do you mean?” Liam questions.

“The stuff about the treaties and how the Army of the Allied Polities may be officially allocated and dispersed, or whatever…”

Liam looks confused. Henry and Gavin look confused. But I can tell Alex just worked it out, and it looks like Peter and Giorgi are nearly there too.

Alex bursts out laughing. “You didn’t, except you’re you, so of course you did! Nice, sis.”

I shrug.

“How could you not know that?” Henry asks. “*Everyone* knows that.”

“Everyone who ends up at the war college would know that,” Peter says, starting to follow the statement to its logical conclusion. “Because to end up there you have to have already been in one of the polities’ armies and transferred to the Army of the Allied Polities—officially—prior to attending the war college. At which point they would have made it abundantly clear. You probably have to sign something in triplicate asserting you understand.”

“Yeah. That,” I affirm, draining my glass. “Or not that, depending on your perspective.”

Giorgi starts laughing.

“Hazel,” Liam growls, “where were you before the war college?”

“Oh, you know. Here. In Branton,” I shrug, and wave at the barman to bring me another round.

“And how exactly did you end up at the war college?”

I wait until the barman comes and sets another pint in front of me. Finally, I answer, “I sort of decided it seemed like a good place to hide in plain sight and keep track of what was happening.”

“How?”

“I mean… orders and enrollment documents are just paper. If you know what the paper looks like it’s pretty easy to add one more that looks like all the rest and says, ‘Hazel Raidane,’” I say with a shrug.

“So you forged your way into the war college?” Liam hisses.

Gavin is laughing now too, and Henry’s eyes have gone big.

“Yes?” I say, like it’s a question whose answer I am unsure of and that will somehow make it less wrong, when that is, in fact, exactly what I did. “In my defense, it seemed like a good idea at the time.”

“I told you it wasn’t a good idea at the time,” Davy reminds me.

“Yeah, well, it *was* working out just fine until all of this.”

Giorgi and Gavin are still laughing. Peter looks like he has a headache, and Henry looks like he has no idea who I am. Liam looks… irate.

“And no one noticed?” Peter questions, like he can’t believe it.

“No. It was easy. Be quiet, do what everyone else is doing, and blend in. That’s all fitting in anywhere ever is,” I shrug.

“Cheers,” Alex says, clinking his glass against mine. “Say one thing about our childhood. Say we can fit the fuck in.”

I grin.

“Jokes. You two have jokes right now?” Liam asks incredulously.

We both shrug.

“It’s not like I can undo it.”

Liam looks like he has a headache now, too.

“Okay, so the papers you forged,” Liam begins, going into damage control, “where did they *say* you were before coming to the war college?”

“Firgasu.” It was as close to the truth as anything, and all good lies are built on as much truth as you can manage.

“Well, at least that’s something,” Liam mutters. “But it still complicates pretty much everything. I think we’re going to need Amelia on our side, and I’m not sure how realistic a goal that is. No one might have looked too hard at your paperwork before, Hazel, but they damn well might, now.”

“You think she can convince her family to amend their records?” I guess.

“I think she *can*, but I have no idea if she *will*,” Liam responds.

“And what do we tell her about Lisette? The truth?” I’m skeptical that will go over well.

“Maybe,” Davy says. “I mean, her family is more interested in stopping Iverson than anything else, and they all do think you’re the key to that,” he shrugs.

“Based on the words of a madwoman,” I mutter, as I take another drink.

“Yeah, well. We work with what we’ve got, and that’s not much right now.”

“Fine. How are we going to get her away from my mother?” I ask Peter.

He shrugs. “I don’t know. I’ll do something to piss her off, and then we’ll go from there, I guess,” he replies, taking a sip of his drink.

I look at Liam, “I think he’s even worse at planning than I am,” I remark disparagingly.

Liam looks between us and sighs. “Do you think you can get her to come back here with you?” he finally asks Peter.

“Probably.”

“Okay.”

----

It’s been at least two and a half hours since Peter left again, taking Giorgi and Gavin with him. I have long since grown bored and managed to work my way into another table’s poker game using the remainder of the money I lifted from someone’s pocket on the way into town, combined with what Alex had. I didn’t see Alex pick anyone’s pocket, but I’m pretty sure he did. The same way I’m pretty sure he didn’t see me pick anyone’s pocket. But based on the look he gave me when it came time to pay for the first round of drinks and the two of us were the only ones with money, I’m pretty sure he knows I did too. Cheers. It’s not something I make a habit of, but needs must and all that. Except for Davy, who knows us both well enough, I’m not sure where the others think the money came from. But they haven’t asked so I haven’t said.

Now I’m working on getting some more money the honest way. Or at least the slightly less dishonest way. I’ve managed to increase what I started with tenfold by the time Peter walks back in with Gavin, Giorgi, and Amelia in tow. So even though I’m forced to bow out of the game, at least we can all eat tonight and I can pay the remainder of our tab. I take what I’ve won and return to my own table with the intent of letting someone other than me do the talking.

“Hey Amelia,” I greet as I sit down.

“I can’t believe you guys left us,” she says.

“We don’t even get a ‘hello’ before you start berating us?”

“You should have heard her the entire way here,” Peter mutters. “You owe me,” he says as he flags down the barman.

“Do I?” I ask him seriously.

“Fine. But I want a drink and it looks like you’ve got all the money, as usual.”

“Yeah, sure,” I agree, then raising my voice so the barman will hear me, “Another round for the table.”

“You left us,” Amelia repeats.

“Blame Michael,” I tell her.

“How is it Michael’s fault?” she asks hotly.

“He is, or at least was—but I see no reason to expect that it’s changed—sleeping with Christine. And the very first thing we told him when she came on board was not to.”

“He’s… You’re kidding, right?” she probes in disbelief.

“No, I’m amazed you haven’t noticed. Ask him.”

“I will,” she says decisively. “What do you all want? And where is Lisette?”

I take that as my cue to let someone else do the talking.

“Lisette’s dead,” Alex answers, before anyone else has the chance to speak.

“What? How?” Amelia asks, looking more surprised than upset by the news.

“You remember how we told you all that magic could go sideways fast?” Alex inquires.

Amelia nods.

“Well, it went sideways for Lisette,” he says.

It’s technically true. Nicely done, Alex.

“Well, damn,” Amelia mutters.

“As for your first question, we need your help,” Liam tells her.

“With?” Amelia asks suspiciously.

“Me,” I admit, when Liam looks at me. “I forged the documents for my enrollment into the war college. We need your family to create the records supporting those documents.”

“Why would they want to help you with that?”

“It’s honestly the best way to limit Dairuvar’s access to Hazel, which is to the benefit of all of Firgasu, if you believe Alexandria,” Liam supplies.

“I’ll think about it,” Amelia states.

“Well think fast,” Liam responds, “because we all, you included, need to go back and as soon as we do, the clock is going to start ticking.”

“Fine. I’ll write them. What do the records need to say?”

### 16 - The Boys Are Back in Town

Alex, Giorgi, and I break off from the others after Amelia leaves. I need to retrieve the copy of Liam’s key that I made what feels like forever ago. Fortunately, I didn’t leave it in my room at the college, unfortunately I left it at Davy’s. Well, wedged into some of the brickwork near the roof of his building. I think there’s a solid chance someone could be watching Davy’s flat, which is why I’m bringing Alex and Giorgi with me. Alex had more or less been living at Davy’s before we left, so hopefully he’ll notice anything out of the ordinary I might miss. And no one should be looking for Giorgi at all. I didn’t bring Davy because, supposedly, Iverson wants me *and* Davy, so at least this way, if it all goes pear shaped, he doesn’t get both of us.

We’ve been watching the building from a rooftop a couple of blocks away for about half an hour, and haven’t seen anything. As far as any of us can tell, everything is completely normal. I don’t buy it though. If I was Iverson, or even my mother, I would have found this place and I would be watching it. Davy and I did our best not to be noticed, but it’s not like we were ghosts. I’m sure we left traces of ourselves all over the city, which someone could find if they really wanted to.

“What do you think?” Alex asks.

I sigh. “I don’t like it. Giorgi, what do you think about going to knock on the door?”

“Yeah, I could do that,” he says with a shrug.

“Be ready to talk yourself out of it. Or run,” Alex tells him.

Giorgi nods and disappears over the side of the building. A few minutes later, I see him approaching Davy’s building.

“Curtains just moved,” Alex notes.

“Damn.”

Giorgi knocks but no one answers, so he starts banging on the door. I think he’s shouting too, but whoever is in the flat isn’t taking the bait. After a few minutes, Giorgi gives up and walks away.

It’s another fifteen minutes before he shows back up on the rooftop.

“Pretty sure there’s someone in there,” he informs us.

“Yeah, I saw the curtains move,” Alex responds. “What do you want to do, Hazel?”

“I still need to get the key. I’ll circle around a few blocks and go across the rooftops.”

“They’ll hear you when you hit the roof,” Alex tells me.

I want to argue the point—he didn’t hear me when I was on the roof, but I climbed up that time, I didn’t jump onto the roof.

“Do you have a better idea?” I question.

“How mad do you think Davy would be about the windows?” Giorgi asks.

“What do you have in mind?”

“I was already there making a scene. I could go back and make a bigger one.” Giorgi shrugs. “Throw a brick or two through the windows. If we time it right, it will cover up any noise you’ll make when you land on the roof.”

“That could work. What do you think, Alex?”

“I think we need some bricks.”

I nod. “Give me ten or fifteen minutes.”

There aren’t any loose bricks sitting on this rooftop, but it shouldn’t be hard to find some. One of the buildings around here is bound to have some. It’s one of those things I’m running into all the time: piles of bricks left abandoned on rooftops. I guess the builders always think they’ll need more bricks than they do, and then when they don’t use them all, laziness wins out and they leave them rather than carrying them back down. That, or they want mayhem makers to be well equipped.

I find what I’m looking for on the third rooftop I check. I manage to fit eight bricks in my bag. Should be more than enough. Hopefully.

I make my way back to Alex and Giorgi and hand Giorgi my bag.

“I’ll circle around, and go over the rooftops until I get to that building,” I say, pointing at the one closest to Davy’s. “Once I get there, I’ll wait until you make your way back to Davy’s. Throw the first brick, and when I hear it hit I’ll count to five and then jump. You throw a second brick at the same time. With any luck, they’ll never notice I was up there.”

Giorgi nods.

“I’ll signal if I see anything, Hazel. If I do, leave the key and run,” Alex tells me.

“Okay,” I agree.

----

I’m waiting on the roof of the building next to Davy’s, listening for the sound of the first brick. So far, it’s all quiet. A few minutes go by, and then I hear shouting followed by the tinkling sound of glass shattering.

*One.* The shouting resumes. *Two.* Giorgi knows how to put on a show. *Three.* I think he may have missed his calling as an actor. *Four.* Here goes nothing. *Five.* I jump. It sounds like the second brick hit the same moment as my feet. I hold still for a moment as the shouting resumes, and then begin creeping across the roof. I make it to the far side, and lean over the edge of the roof to the side of the building where there are some loose bricks. I gently pry them out, one by one, then grab the key. I don’t bother putting the bricks back. I creep away and jump back to the building I came from. Giorgi has stopped shouting, so I make my exit as quickly as I can.

By the time I return to the roof where we left Alex, Giorgi is already there.

“All good?” Alex asks.

“Yeah. Now we need to make sure that we’re not followed.”

“Any idea who was in the flat?”

“No. Giorgi?”

He shakes his head.

“Okay, let’s go.”

----

We spend a few hours circling around the city, going over rooftops and through buildings. Sometimes merely standing inside an entry way for ten or fifteen minutes at a stretch. We separate and come back together a few times, and as far as any of us can tell, no one is following us.

Eventually we meet back up with the others, who left Gavin waiting to tell us that they relocated to a twenty-four hour cafe several blocks away.

“Did you know your brother’s a surprisingly good actor?” I ask Gavin as we walk. “He plays the part of ‘angry man with brick’ pretty convincingly.”

“Can’t say I’m surprised. So you were right, then? Someone was watching the building?”

“Yeah. Although they didn’t seem to know who Giorgi was. At least not by sight.”

We walk in silence for a bit until we reach the cafe.

Everyone is sitting around drinking coffee when we walk in and I’m not sure I’ve ever been so jealous in my life. It feels like forever since I’ve had a cup of coffee.

“Alright, we can go,” I say to the group.

“Or we can sit,” Alex says. “And we can all eat something too, since I’m guessing there’s not a stocked kitchen where we’re going.”

Liam shakes his head when he notices Alex looking at him.

“Fine,” I grumble in agreement.

“Did you eat yet, Gavin?” Alex inquires.

“Not yet, but even if I had, I could always eat again.”

Alex comes back and hands out menus. “They have waffles, Hazel.”

----

“What do you think?” I ask Liam as we walk. “Henry, Gavin, Giorgi, and Peter in the flat on the second floor? The rest of us in the one on the fifth?”

“For now,” he nods.

“Okay.”

When we reach the building, I hand my un-magicked key to Peter.

“You guys first,” Liam tells him.

“You’re not coming?” Peter asks.

“We are, different key though. I’ll show you tomorrow. Let’s meet back here at ten. I have no idea how knocking will work,” Liam says more to himself than anyone else but it earns him several odd looks. It must be too late for questions though, since no one asks for any clarification.

“Alex, Davy, you’re with us tonight,” Liam states. “Peter, lock the door behind you after you go in.”

Peter nods.

“Well, this is all very weird,” Alex comments.

“You have no idea. Liam, let Davy open the door. But Davy, let Liam go up the stairs first.”

Davy nods and Liam passes him the key. Davy inserts the key into the lock, and then withdraws his hand. “What *is* that?” he asks looking at me.

“Not mine,” I answer. Davy looks at Liam and I say, “Not his either.”

“Whose, then?”

“We’re not sure.”

Davy gives Liam a hard look.

“Really,” Liam informs him. “I inherited the key. So I assume my parents’, but I don’t actually know. We’re going to try to find out.”

“Alex you’ve got to feel this,” Davy tells him, moving back from the door.

Alex reaches out to touch the key. “Huh.”

“Take it out of the door,” Davy urges.

“Now, *that* is interesting,” Alex says once he removes the key.

“Can we go in?” Liam asks, and he seems a little bit on edge. “We can talk about how interesting all this is inside, but we look really suspicious standing around in front of a door talking about how weird it is.”

“Yeah, okay,” Davy agrees and Alex hands the key back to Liam.

Once we walk through the door, Liam locks it behind us.

“Wait here a second,” I order Alex and Davy as Liam begins ascending the stairs and disarming the trip wires. “Okay, you can go now,” I tell them, once he’s done all four.

Liam hands me the key as we walk past, and he sets about rearming them.

“I don’t think we have any idea who Liam is,” Alex mutters to Davy as we continue going up the stairs. “I’m beginning to see why Hazel likes him so much.”

I roll my eyes, but he’s probably right. You look at Liam and think you know what you’re getting, but then he does something that surprises you. So you reset your expectations, and once again, you think you know who Liam is, until he does the next thing you never saw coming.

Once we get to the top of the staircase, I unlock the next door and let Alex and Davy go through while I wait for Liam. His hand brushes across mine as I pass back the key, invoking memories of the last time we were here. Without company. I sigh, and Liam grins as if he knows what I’m thinking. We go through the door and Liam locks it behind us as well.

“Okay, explain,” Alex orders once we turn to face him. He and Davy have both taken seats at the table where— Nope. Not thinking about that.

“The other key—the one I gave to Peter—is, at least as far as the physical shape of the key is concerned, identical to the key we used to get into this flat. But when that key opens the door from the street, the staircase only goes to the second floor. There’s no way to use that key to get to this flat.”

“Is your key the only one that can open the door to this flat?” Davy queries, eying the key currently in Liam’s hand.

“As far as I know,” Liam answers, passing it back to Davy.

Davy turns it over in his hands.

“When the key is in the lock, it feels a lot like whatever magic she used to bind Liam to her,” I tell Davy.

He nods without looking up.

I wait while Davy continues to look at the key. After a few minutes, he hands it to Alex. Alex sets it on the table when he’s done looking at it.

“I don’t think one person did all this,” Davy states finally.

“Yeah, I had wondered about that myself.”

Davy nods. “I think if we wanted to recreate this, it would take at least you and me working together to do it. You, to provide the power and me to stabilize it all. Maybe after we’d done it a couple of times you could replicate it alone, but the first time? I doubt it.” He drums his fingers over the table top lightly for a few minutes then finally sighs. “Fuck. It’d probably be a lot like the clearing. But worse. So much worse. I’d have to get everything set up, and then you’d have to blast the power through me. I wouldn’t be able to pull it through you fast enough.”

“That would be… unbelievably dangerous,” I say, but I know I’m not telling him anything he doesn’t already know.

He nods.

“What about tying the other key to this flat, since all the magic already exists?” I inquire.

“I could probably figure it out in a few days,” he answers.

“Do you think it’s close enough to figure out how to undo what she did?”

“Maybe. I’ll have a better idea in a few days.”

“We should bring him to Reese’s when we go to talk to her,” I tell Liam. “She might know something that will help, and Davy will know which questions to ask if she does.”

Liam nods.

“Why doesn’t this place have any furniture?” Alex finally asks, looking at Liam.

Liam shrugs. “Never needed any. No one actually lives here.”

### 17 - Get Over It

The next morning I’m up early sitting on the rooftop, watching the sunrise over the city. I only slept a couple of hours. Liam finds me after I’ve been out here for about thirty minutes.

“Couldn’t sleep?” I ask when he wraps his arms around me.

“I noticed you were gone.”

“I was thinking about going to Reese’s churro shop. We should watch it for a while first. Make sure no one is staking it out, since someone was watching Davy’s flat.”

“Not a bad idea,” Liam agrees. “You should take Peter.”

I can’t help but sigh.

“You know I’m right. He’s the best person to go with you,” Liam states evenly.

“*You* could come with me,” I protest.

“I could, but Peter is a better option. And it will give you two a chance to talk. Alone. You need to get over it, Hazel. We need Peter, and you’ve been making things difficult for months now. You need to let it go.”

“I don’t think I do,” I tell him as I step out of his arms and walk back inside.

“You do,” Liam asserts, as he follows me.

“He’s right, Hazel,” I hear Alex concur from somewhere further inside. “You’re making things difficult for everyone. Not just Peter.”

“Stop listening to conversations you’re not part of, Alex.”

“Oh, are we having the Peter conversation?” Davy asks as he walks out of the bathroom.

“I hate you all,” I tell them. Clearly they’ve been discussing this. Probably for a while.

“It’s possible, Hazel, that if everyone thinks you’re the problem,” Davy states, “you might actually be the problem.”

“Seriously?” I question, incredulously.

“Seriously,” Davy answers. “Peter has apologized. You’re the one dragging this out.”

“Peter apologized, and then right as I *started* to forgive him he tried to start a fight between Liam and me!”

“Yeah, and he won’t do it again,” Liam assures me.

“Why? Because you broke his nose? I’ve suffered worse injuries and come back for seconds,” I snap as I spin back toward him

“No.”

“Then why? What’s he got to lose? What’s to stop him from fucking me over? From fucking us *all* over?”

“Peter and I have talked,” Liam states.

“Okay, about what?”

“Do you trust me?” he asks, reaching out to take my hands as he stares into my eyes.

“Yes, of course I trust you,” I answer as I meet his gaze.

“Then trust me when I tell you that he won’t.”

“Fine. Whatever,” I bite out. “I’ll take Peter.” *And make him answer my questions,* I think.

Alex sighs.

----

Peter and I are sitting on a blanket in a small green space across from Reese’s shop, watching the storefront. We haven’t been here long. Probably less than twenty minutes, and hopefully to anyone passing by, we simply look like a couple of people enjoying the mild weather.

“Liam says I need to forgive you.” I state, breaking the silence. “Davy and Alex, evidently, agree with him. They say I need to get over it. That I’m the one who’s the problem right now.”

Peter flicks his eyes in my direction, so I know he’s listening, but he wisely says nothing.

“And you know, I was actually ready to let it go back in Leisch. Before you tried to start a fight between Liam and me.”

Peter sighs, but still doesn’t say anything.

“I told Liam you make it hard to trust you when you do shit like that, and he said it was sorted. That you two had talked and he was sure you wouldn’t do anything like that again, and not because he broke your nose. When I asked why, he said I should ask you,” I lie.

Peter sighs again. Several minutes pass in silence, but I wait.

Finally, Peter says, “I’m sorry about Leisch. I shouldn’t have lobbed what I knew was a bomb into the conversation and then walked away. I stand by the fact that Liam needed to know, but you’re both right that he didn’t need to know like that, and that it wasn’t my place to tell him.”

He sounds… sincere. It makes me even more suspicious. Which annoys me, because maybe they’re right. Maybe there is no way for Peter to win with me right now.

“And yes, Liam and I have talked about it. But I also know he didn’t tell you to ask me to relay the content of those conversations to you.”

“It was worth a shot,” I mutter. “You’re all asking me to have a whole lot of faith in you when history demonstrates absolutely no reason I should.”

“I think Liam is asking you to have faith in *him*,” Peter responds.

What in the hell am I supposed to say to that? That I don’t have faith in anyone? That half the time I’m not sure I trust anyone?

I’ve forgiven Alex for more or less the same thing a half a dozen times over. But Alex has also saved my life a half a dozen times over to make up for it.

I decide to lay my cards on the table. “I want to trust you. I really do. It would make it easier for me. It would make it easier for Liam. It would make it easier for everyone. But for as long as I’ve known you, I’ve done nothing to you except keep you alive. Whereas you’ve erased my memory, lied to me, and tried to drive a wedge between me and Liam, so hopefully you can see why it might be difficult for me.”

“I get it, but it’s also like you said yesterday: it’s not like I can undo any of that.”

“Yeah. I know.”

“So where does that leave us?” Peter questions softly.

“Trust is earned, so maybe try earning some, Peter. Stop acting like I’m going to bite you every time we’re in the same room together. I can’t make myself trust you, but I’ll stop with the snide remarks.”

“Alright.”

We sit silently, watching the shop. After a bit I ask something I’ve been wondering for a while. “What was with you trying to get my mother to call me by my name?”

“*You* wanted her to call you by your name.”

“Yeah, but somehow you were the only other person correcting her.”

He shrugs.

“I don’t know if you’re shrugging because that’s your answer, or because you don’t want to answer.”

After a long pause, Peter explains, “It seemed important to you and it was a small ask. She clearly wasn’t listening when you told her, so I thought maybe if someone else did…”

“Thanks.”

“It didn’t seem to help.”

“Yeah, well. Nothing does with her.”

We fall back into silence, neither of us having much to say to the other. I’m both bored and annoyed. I begin pulling some small purple flowers from the ground in irritation and twisting them into a crown as I watch the shop.

Peter’s eyes dart back and forth between the shop and my hands for several minutes before he finally comments, “You really can’t sit still, can you?”

“I prefer not to.”

“Giorgi calls it a character trait, you know.”

“I’m aware.”

“You guys seem to talk a lot,” Peter remarks.

I shrug. “Giorgi doesn’t talk ‘a lot’ to anyone. Giorgi makes Liam seem like a chatterbox in comparison.”

“And yet you two get along fine.”

“I get along with everyone.”

“Except me.”

“Pretty much.”

“I asked you about your panic attacks, back in the pass,” Peter begins.

“I remember. After you basically nodded to yourself when I initially mentioned it. Like I was confirming something you suspected.”

“Yeah. Well I meant what I said about you not being the only one to have ever had a panic attack.”

I don’t say anything.

“Reese was basically forced into coming to Branton, and then when I was thirteen, I was forced to join her.”

I had long wondered how one of the Crears ended up as a housekeeper for Liam’s grandparents.

“Your father wanted someone watching the Martens, just in case. Then when Liam showed up, apparently Reese alone wasn’t enough.”

“Why your family?”

“Because Reese and my mom were friends with yours, once upon a time. And because we’ve never been as magically gifted as the Iversons or Raidanes. Or even the Clarences, I guess.” Peter sighs. “Did you know I have a much younger brother?”

“No.”

“I haven’t seen him since he was two, when I was sent here to live with Reese, and he was, nominally, fostered out to the Clarences. I couldn’t even pick him out of a crowd.”

“Ah. Leverage.”

He nods.

“Why are you telling me this?” I ask suspiciously.

“To explain.”

“You’re still not going to tell me why Liam says I should trust you?” I inquire, trying again.

“No.”

I sigh. “Go walk over to the shop and say hi. See what happens. Here,” I say, as I hand him the flower crown I’ve been making. “You can give that to Reese.”

I watch Peter walk across and enter the shop. Nothing changes, which is good. He walks in and Reese immediately rushes to hug him the same way she did all those months ago with Liam. He hugs her back and then hands her the flower crown. She looks at it intently for a moment, and then looks at Peter in question. He shrugs. They talk for a few more minutes and then she hands him a bag. He hugs her and walks back out.

Everything looks the same.

Peter crosses back to where I’m sitting on the blanket, and hands me the bag. “Here. Liam said you like churros.”

“Thanks,” I say as I take the bag from him. I open it and lift it to inhale the scent of cinnamon and sugar. All churros are good churros, but these are *really* good churros.

“She knew something was up with the flower crown,” Peter comments.

“So it would seem,” I agree, as I pull out a churro and take a bite. Magic. This is actual magic. Way better than anything I can do. “Did you tell her who I was? After Liam brought me here?” I probe.

“No. I didn’t find out you had been here until somewhat recently. Liam didn’t tell me and Reese never mentioned it.”

“Haven’t you wondered why? I mean, you say she and my mother were best friends, and you’ve seen my mother. There’s no way she didn’t have a solid guess about who I was. Seems like the sort of thing you’d mention.”

He shrugs. “We can ask her once the others get here, if you want.”

“Do you want one of these?” I ask as I shake the bag of churros in his direction.

“No. I’m pretty sure they’re for you.”

“Did you tell her I was here?” I wonder, since I don’t think she’d be able to see us from the shop.

“No.”

“Then why… The flower crown. Huh.”

“What?”

“Do you know how to make a flower crown?”

“No, why would I?”

“Indeed. Why would anyone? Why do I?”

“Is that a rhetorical question?” Peter asks, confused.

“I know how to make flower crowns. Alex knows how to make flower crowns. I bet Reese knows how to make flower crowns too. I bet we all make them the same way.” I sigh. “Do you think she’s still friends with my mother?”

“I don’t think so, but I don’t really know that for sure.”

“Well, let’s hope not.”

----

Another hour goes by before Alex, Davy, and Liam arrive. I’ve long since finished off the churros when they take a seat on the blanket with us.

“Anything?” Liam asks.

“No,” Peter answers and I shake my head.

“And have you two spent the past couple of hours becoming fast friends?” Alex teases.

“Yeah. Peter braided my hair and everything,” I tell him sarcastically.

“Are you two good?” Liam inquires seriously.

I look at Peter to find him looking at me as well. We both shrug.

Liam sighs, and I can hear the frustration in his voice as he says, “Come on. Let’s go talk to Reese.”

We enter the shop together, with Liam at the front and Peter bringing up the rear. Once we’re inside, Peter flips the sign on the door to closed and locks it behind him. Reese comes out from the back and takes one look at our group of five, and then lets out an exhale that makes it sound like she has the weight of the world pressing down on her shoulders. There are no hugs for anyone this time.

“I’ve been expecting you,” she says to me.

“Since when?” I respond in question.

“Since Liam brought you here.”

“Sorry to have kept you waiting?”

She laughs. “So who are your friends?”

“This is my brother Alex and my cousin Davy,” I introduce, gesturing to them in turn as she nods to each.

“Well, you all may as well sit down.”

The sound of the chair legs scraping across the floor seems to echo ominously within the space today.

“Has my mother been to see you yet?” I ask her.

Reese’s eyes widen slightly. “No. She’s back?”

“Yes, and you sound… worried? Which would make sense if you were me, but Peter says you used to be best friends.”

“Emphasis on the ‘used to.’”

“So what happened?”

“She changed. Right around the time her brother died. She… I don’t know how she is now, but she became a different person after he died. It was subtle at first. Or maybe I didn’t want to see it, but she became meaner and more vindictive. She went from being a person who had friends, to being someone who only had people she used when she needed something from them. It wasn’t long after that that our friendship fell apart.”

When I don’t offer any response, Liam picks up the conversation. “Reese, you gave me a key you said my mother left for me. We need to know whatever it is you know about that key. How it was made, who made it, and why.”

“I—” Reese begins to rise, but Liam catches her wrists.

“It’s important. Please.”

Reese looks down at Liam’s hands on her wrists, and he lets go. “Your father made it,” she tells Liam. “With the help of Randall Iverson and William Raidane. That’s how he died,” she says softly. “They did something that made that key and the doors it unlocks, and it killed William and then Alexandria… It doesn’t matter. Anyway, it was the three of them together who made it. They wanted to prove they could, so they did, but it killed William in the process, and it didn’t seem like either of them had much regret about that. Then James ended up with the key and gave it to Emma, and Emma gave it to me. I think James wanted to keep it away from Randall. Emma told me James told Randall it was stolen.”

“Why did he want it?” I ask.

“Why does Randall want anything?” Reese murmurs the question, and I get the feeling it’s rhetorical.

“Do you know *how* they made it?” I probe.

“Why?” she asks suspiciously.

“My mother did something to Liam. Something that feels a lot like the magic on that key,” I explain.

“You look so much like her, you know.”

“I’m aware,” I state flatly.

“But you’re nothing like her. Not like how she was before William died, or who she became after. You made the flower crown Peter gave me earlier?”

I nod.

“We used to make crowns like that. I recognized the weaving. I taught her that,” Reese says, and I get the distinct impression she’s trying to avoid answering the question.

“What was she like before?” Alex asks, letting her.

“Quiet. Smart. Kind of a wallflower. Content to let others take the credit for her cleverness.”

I can’t even begin to imagine my mother as that person, and based on Alex’s expression neither can he.

“The key, Reese?” Liam says, directing the conversation back to the original topic.

“I don’t know exactly what they did. I wasn’t there, and the kind of stuff they were talking about was so far beyond my understanding.”

“What kind of stuff?” Davy questions.

“You’re Christine’s child?” she asks Davy.

He nods.

“I hope you’ll forgive me, but I never did like her very much.”

“It’s an opinion I share,” Davy assures her. “She’s with Alexandria now.”

Reese sighs. “I don’t know. They were talking about using Randall to power the magic, and James to amplify it, and William to focus it. I don’t know the specifics beyond that. It was originally Alexandria’s idea. She would know more.”

“Well, that explains why what she did to Liam feels so similar,” I mutter. At least it means my suspicions are correct. I can figure out how to undo this. Or Davy and I together can. We just have to get it right the first time. No pressure.

“Do you know about the prophecy?” I ask.

Reese rolls her eyes. “The prophecy,” she mutters, seeming to echo how I feel.

“So you don’t think my mother’s a seer or a prophet?”

“No,” Reese states flatly. “I think your mother knows how to pay attention and make educated guesses, and I think sometimes she gets lucky.”

I ball my hands into fists beneath the table as I resist the urge to look at Peter and smirk since, while a smirk isn’t technically a comment, doing so would probably still be snide.

My effort must show though, because Peter sighs, “Go ahead and say it, Hazel. I know you want to.”

“I *wasn’t* going to say anything, but since you bring it up: I told you!” I burst out, never one to deny an outright invitation to say I was right.

Reese laughs again. “Point of contention?”

“A bit,” I admit. “Even if it’s not real, do you know what it says? We need to know and my mother wouldn’t tell us.”

Reese thinks for a minute. “It was some stupid rhyme.”

“Mom’s specialty,” Alex mutters.

“Something like:
>   Forge their bonds into a chain,
>   Use their lives to stake a claim.
>   With secret deals and silent force,
>   Rise unchecked and stay the course.
>
>   Bend their wills for endless breath,
>   Cheat the grave, outrun death.
>   Immortal now, your soul is bright,
>   And all you gained is yours by right.
>
>   The tides of fate will turn at last,
>   And allies strong will be outcast.
>   Your rule undone, your power claimed,
>   Usurped by those I once had named.”

“It’s not even any good,” Alex scoffs when Reese is done.

“To be fair,” Reese responds, “I think it started out as a joke. Alexandria was convinced she could make the others believe she could predict the future, and it worked. At least with Randall.”

“So what you’re telling me is he’s even crazier than she is,” I comment, letting my head fall onto my arms folded in front of me. The future looks bleak.

“He’s power hungry, but I wouldn’t say he’s crazy,” Reese replies.

“You’d have to be crazy to believe something like that,” I state.

“Maybe not if you’re the kind of powerful that lets you reshape reality,” Reese shrugs. “That kind of power makes most things seem possible.”

“Great,” I mutter.

----

“What are you thinking about?” Liam asks as we slowly walk back to the Ginnelstreet flat, having left Reese’s shop more than half an hour ago.

“Being the kind of powerful that makes most things seem possible,” I answer.

“You mean the kind of powerful that you are?” Liam asks.

“Maybe.”

Liam wraps an arm around my waist. “Did you and Peter talk?”

“Yeah.”

“And?”

I shrug. “I have trust issues. I find it hard to trust Peter simply because you think I should, when you can’t or won’t give me any good reason to,” I answer honestly. “But I told him I’ll stop with the snide remarks if he stops acting like I’m going to bite him every time I walk into a room.”

Liam sighs. “You’re not making this easy.”

“Yeah, well, neither are you. It’s the best I can do for now.”

### 18 - Waiting Room

I spend the next day sequestered in the flat on Ginnelstreet with Davy and Alex, trying to figure out how the key works.

I think Liam might be a little irritated by my refusal to accept on blind faith that things with Peter are good. I meant it when I said I’d stop with the remarks, but trusting anyone is hard for me. Trusting a person based solely on the word of another person, even if that person is Liam, is honestly beyond me. It’s not a matter of being willing or unwilling. I can’t do it. So I’m doing my best but, honestly, I’m not sure if it’s good enough. Part of me gets it. Peter and Liam have been friends since forever. I’m the interloper. Which is both true, and a really shitty feeling to have. I think maybe I’m feeling… insecure? It’s not a feeling I have a ton of experience with.

“What’s up with you?” Alex questions, when it’s clear for about the tenth time my mind is elsewhere.

“I’m not sure.”

“You’re not sure?” Alex asks skeptically.

“It’s all this stuff with Peter and Liam,” I admit.

“Go on.”

“They’ve been friends since they were kids, and Liam wants me to trust Peter, but I can’t. I can stop making it obvious that I don’t, but I don’t know if that will be enough.”

Alex shrugs.

“Thanks. That’s very helpful,” I remark scathingly.

“Do you want me to lie to you and tell you it will all be fine?” Alex retorts in the same tone.

“I don’t know. Maybe.”

“The world as it is, Hazel. You’re right Peter and Liam have been friends for a long time, and Liam is in a tough position. But it’s not just you who’ve put him there. It’s you *and* Peter. And that’s why the two of you, together, need to fix your shit. That’s all Liam wants.”

“I don’t know how.” I admit. “I’ll stop being a dick to Peter, and I told Liam that, but for now that’s all I’ve got.”

“Well, hopefully that’s enough then.”

“Wow. You are *terrible* at this.”

“You want reassurances I can’t give you, sis.”

“Let’s focus on the key,” I finally say.

“Yes. Let’s,” Davy agrees.

“So what do you think we need to do?” I ask Davy.

“I think the original key and locks were probably all cast from the same piece of metal, like the rings.”

“Can we redo it without them all being from the same piece of metal?” I want to know.

“Yeah, but it’s harder. It’ll take more time to do.”

“How much more time?”

“I’m not sure,” Davy tells me.

“Best guess?”

“Maybe a few weeks?”

“You can’t do it faster than that? The day before yesterday you said maybe a few days.”

“Do you want to try it?” Davy responds sharply.

I sigh. “I’d rather see you do it first.”

“Then you’re going to have to wait.”

----

The next day, it’s time for Liam, Henry, Amelia and me to show back up to the war college, and for Liam and me to cross our fingers and hope he’s right. I think he has more faith in his plan than I do, but I’m here with him anyway. So maybe I have more faith in Liam than I realize. Or maybe I like fire. I don’t even know what’s true anymore.

I’m confused about… everything. I’m stuck in a loop waiting for Davy to figure out the key. Waiting for Liam to figure out if the situation between me and Peter is tenable. Waiting to see if Iverson comes after me. Waiting to see if my mother does. Waiting to see if I live out the day.

The four of us walk back through the gates and Henry, Amelia and I return to our rooms, while Liam goes to speak with whomever. The official story is that Firgasu was sending correspondence as normal, and no one knows what happened. The world is a mysterious place. The delegation which was supposed to come couldn’t because the snow in the pass came early, and they decided the smart move was not to chance the crossing. They sent a missive, but like the others, who knows what happened to it? And Lisette died because conditions in the pass were bad, and we weren’t smart and we did chance it.

It’s the most boring series of the simplest lies, and it absolves everyone from wrongdoing. It’s so boring that no one should look twice at it, but that doesn’t mean no one will. Henry and Amelia will be fine either way. They were just along for the ride. Liam’s the one who sanctioned everything, and I’m the one who basically did everything else. I’m not exactly nervous, more anticipating the worst and waiting for the axe to fall.

I set my pack in my room but don’t bother unpacking it. Who knows if it’s worth the time and effort. I stand in the middle of my room for a minute simultaneously grateful to finally have some privacy while also resenting it, or maybe resenting that Liam isn’t here with me. My emotions are such a mess. I want to leave, but I can’t because now people are actually paying attention to me, so I have to be on my best behavior.

It’s everything I never wanted, yet here I am.

I need to go do *something*. I’m going to go crazy if I don’t. Unfortunately, it’s a Sunday. Meaning there’s *nothing* going on. Nothing to distract myself with. Liam might be right that it would be easier in the general sense to come back on a weekend but at least if we’d come back tomorrow there would be things I had to do. Rooms to sit in. People to pretend to listen to. I don’t know. Maybe it wouldn’t have been better.

I decide to go to the gym, where at least I can hit something. I head out of my room and start down the hallway, only to find Amelia coming up it. I have no idea where her room is, but I’m pretty sure it’s not anywhere near here.

I want to tell her to go away. I don’t know what she wants, but I know I’m not in any mood to deal with whatever it is. I’m not fit company for anyone at the moment. If I was anyone else, I’d stay far away from me for the foreseeable future. So I don’t say anything to her, since it feels like anything that comes out of my mouth will be nothing more than a snarl at best, and Amelia hasn’t done anything to deserve that.

“Where are you going?” she asks when she gets close to me.

“The gym.”

“Good, I’ll come too.”

I sigh but don’t tell her not to. When we get to the gym I immediately head for the heavy bag.

“You don’t have gloves,” Amelia comments as I hit the bag the first few times.

I shrug. “Did you want something, Amelia?”

“Do you want to spar?” she invites.

“With you? Now?”

She nods.

“That would be a bad idea.”

“Why? I could take you.”

“Hah,” I scoff. “I’m in a bad mood,” I answer. “It’s not a good time to spar with me.”

She shrugs. “I still say I could take you.”

I look her up and down, considering. I’ve honestly never paid much attention to Amelia. If I’ve thought about her at all—and mostly I haven’t—it’s been in irritation, often relegating her to the role of ‘Peter’s ex,’ which is kind of shitty of me, but we didn’t exactly get off on the right foot, and then it escalated. Then I had bigger problems, and then she was gone. After that, her stupid cousin was causing problems. All of which is to say, I have no idea what I think of Amelia as a person beyond any of that. I have no real idea what she’s capable of.

I’m angry at myself for about a dozen other reasons right now, so let’s add that to the list as well. But at least this one I can address if I start making myself treat Amelia like a person instead of an annoyance.

In that vein, I really consider *her* for the first time. She’s bigger than I am because most people are, but she’s not *that* much bigger. A few inches taller. Maybe twenty or twenty-five pounds heavier than me since I’m still too skinny. But she’s a lot closer to my size than most people are. If I want an actual sparring partner, there aren’t a whole lot of better options around. Assuming she doesn’t suck.

“Are you sure you want to do this? Like I said, I’m not exactly in a great mood.”

“I’ll manage. Besides. You’re not the only one who’s not in a great mood,” she tells me.

“Yeah? What’s eating you?”

“Michael’s a dipshit.”

“You’re just getting that now?” I ask in a mocking tone.

She throws a punch at my face in response. She’s quick, but I’m quicker. I manage to dodge out of the path of her fist, leaving her slightly overextended. I move in close and use the momentum to carry me into her, knocking her sideways a couple of steps, but as I do, she’s smart enough to grab onto me and pull me to the floor with her as she falls.

I come out on top and am raining blows into her ribs, but it only takes her a few seconds to get a leg wrapped around me and throw me off. She tries to wrench my arm into a submission hold as she does so, but I’m flexible enough that I move with her until I can twist away, and we both come back to our feet and begin circling each other.

“You’re better than I thought you’d be,” I acknowledge somewhat begrudgingly.

“You’re about as good as I thought you’d be,” she tells me as she moves back in, faster than she did the first time.

I manage to dodge the punch she throws again, but barely. I dip under her arm and spin behind her, kicking at the back of her knee. It’s merely a glancing blow however, and doesn’t send her to the ground like I had hoped.

“Oh yeah?”

“After the pass I figured I was probably wrong about you,” she explains.

I laugh. “After the pass, I didn’t think about you at all,” I admit as I rush in, feinting with a jab at her face before driving my knee into her stomach. She twists so it catches her in the side and doesn’t knock the wind out of her. At the same time, she grabs my knee and sweeps the foot that was on the ground out from under me. Then she uses the weight of her own body to drive me into the ground. It hurts and it knocks the wind out of me. My entire body wants to seize into a tiny ball as I fight for a breath. I ignore it. This is *good*.

I drive an elbow into her jaw and roll her off of me as I try, and fail, to suck in air. I get back onto my feet, finally gulping in a breath. I see Amelia rubbing at her jaw as I do, but she resumes a fighting stance and I do the same. She launches a kick at me, which I block as I retreat. She tries another, and I catch her leg and use it to shove her backwards. She falls.

As she does, I feel something ripple across the atmosphere and it feels like the inside of my head is rapidly expanding. I turn, searching for the source of the sensation. I’ve never felt anything like it in my life.

Near the door, I see Liam with a drawn look on his face. It takes a moment before I register the man standing next to him, and another moment before recognition clicks into place. General Iverson, wearing a completely closed expression as he watches us.

Amelia’s legs hit mine, and I’m so dumbstruck I make no move to roll, twist, or otherwise control the fall. I feel the base of my skull smack into the floor, and then the blackness swallows me up.

### 19 - Bad Girls

I wake up with a pounding headache and nausea and… a possible concussion? What the hell happened?

“I told you I could take you,” someone says to my left.

“What?” I ask, and I think it comes out sounding as garbled as I feel. I try to sit up and, oh. That is *not* a good idea.

“You lost.”

“Amelia, you can go now,” Liam exhales in irritation.

“Fine. I just wanted to make sure she knows.”

I hear the door open and shut.

“What happened?” I ask.

“You don’t remember?” Liam questions, and I hear the concern in his voice.

“I remember Amelia and I were sparring.” I pause. “And then I remember seeing you. And… Was General Iverson with you?”

“Yes,” Liam says tightly. “I want Alex to look at your head. Can you get him here, please?”

“With Iverson here? No way.”

“Please? You were unconscious for a good thirty minutes and I’m pretty sure you have a concussion.”

“I definitely have a concussion,” I mutter. “With Iverson here, it’s not safe.”

“He’ll figure it out,” Liam states.

“Fine,” I relent. “What happened?”

“You lost.”

“Yeah, after that?”

“Iverson watched you for a minute and then walked out without saying a word.”

“Why was he there?”

“According to him, he wanted to meet the others who went to Firgasu.”

“How did he know we were there?”

“I don’t know,” Liam says, shaking his head. “Iverson was waiting with Commander Selby when I went to speak to him. Then when I was done, Iverson said he wanted to meet the others, and went straight to the gym.”

I wasn’t using any magic. I haven’t used any magic since before we got back to Branton. How did he know where I was? Amelia? Maybe. I’ll have to ask her. But if not… I don’t like the implications of that.

“What did he do?” Liam inquires. “I felt magic rolling out from him, but I don’t know what it was.”

“I have no idea. I’ve never felt anything like it in my life. It almost felt like a sounding.”

“A sounding?”

“Yeah, like when you measure the size or distance of something by seeing how long it takes a sound wave to move across it.” I note the look of confusion on his face. “Like with thunder. Never mind. It’s not important. I think maybe he was measuring my magic?”

“Can he do that? Can you do that?”

“I have absolutely no idea to either question.” I want to go to sleep even though I know it would be a bad idea. Instead, I ask, “Did he say anything?”

“‘Ah.’”

I close my eyes. “Before or after you felt his magic?”

“After.”

“Well, damn.” My head somehow hurts worse, if that’s possible. “Can you go ask Amelia if she’s done any magic—anything at all—since we got back here?”

“Okay, I’ll talk to her once Alex gets here.”

“How did the rest of it go?” I ask, trying to focus on something other than the pain, nausea, and desire to go to sleep.

“It was fine. I think Commander Selby was as surprised to have General Iverson sitting in as I was. In some ways it probably made that portion easier.”

“Did Iverson ask any questions?”

“No. He just sat there and stared at us expressionlessly.”

“Great. Has Peter talked to him at all yet?”

“Not that I know of,” Liam responds.

“You should ask him. He’s going to have to,” I tell Liam, even though the thought only adds to my nausea.

I obviously knew Peter would have to talk to Iverson at some point, and I didn’t like the idea then, but since some point is apparently now, I like the idea even less. I am literally going to have to trust Peter based on nothing at all. Or maybe it doesn’t even matter. Iverson is already here. I’m not sure what Peter could say to him that would make it worse. Iverson evidently knows exactly who I am, and if I had to guess he’s got a pretty solid idea what I’m capable of. At this point, the best we can probably hope to do is to keep Alex and Davy off his radar, and I have no idea how feasible that is. Maybe if I’m interesting enough, he’ll forget to look for Davy.

“Okay,” Liam agrees. “How’s your head?”

“I’ll live. At least for tonight. Probably.”

Liam spends the next forty minutes, or so, it takes for Alex to arrive asking approximately once a minute if I’m awake. By the time I hear a tapping on the window, I’m about five minutes away from trying to strangle Liam simply to make him stop asking if I’m awake.

“You couldn’t come through the door?” Liam questions as he opens the window for Alex.

“I left my Captain of the Guard costume in Davy’s flat,” Alex answers sarcastically. “Makes walking through the building a little harder. Do me a favor and bring me a new one? Save me the trouble of getting it myself? Unless you want me snooping through your things, in which case I’m happy to oblige. I *am* interested in what other secrets you might be keeping.”

“I’ll trade you for it,” Liam tells him.

I see a speculative look on Alex’s face when I glance toward the foot of the bed where they’re talking, and even pointing my eyes in that direction is enough to send a new wave of nausea roiling through me.

“What happened to Hazel?” Alex inquires, seeming to notice I’m here for the first time.

“She lost,” Liam says.

“I did not lose. It doesn’t count,” I retort.

“What was it you told Gavin before? Winning is winning and dead is dead?”

“Piss off and go talk to Amelia, Liam.” I bite out. “And bring Alex a uniform when you come back. Please.”

I hear the door open and close, then Alex asks again, “What happened?”

“I fucking lost. To Amelia,” I grit out.

“You lost a fight to Amelia?” Alex responds, incredulously.

“To be fair, she’s better than you would expect, but I was surprised.”

“By?”

“Can you fix my head first? So I can talk without fighting the urge to projectile vomit all over you? But with as little power as you possibly can.”

Alex reaches around to the back of my head, and the pain fades from stabbing to bearable to gone in seconds.

“Thanks,” I say, as I’m finally able to leverage myself into a sitting position.

“So what happened?”

“Amelia and I were sparring. Then all of a sudden it felt like… I don’t know. Like standing next to a really large bell that was ringing, only without any sound. It was like the inside of my head was expanding. And when I looked around to figure out what the hell it was, I saw Iverson standing there watching us. Then Amelia got lucky, and the ground took issue with my head.”

“Iverson? He was here watching you?” Alex asks, looking as concerned as I feel.

“Yeah.”

“How did he know where to find you?”

“No clue. I haven’t done any magic since well before we got back, exactly because of this. Maybe if Amelia did something? Who knows what mom taught her while we were gone,” I mutter.

“What do you think he was doing? Could Liam feel it?”

“Yeah, Liam felt it, but not like I did. I told Liam it felt like a sounding but for magic. I’m pretty sure he was trying to figure out exactly how powerful I am.”

“Do you think he did?”

“Yeah, maybe. Or at least I think he’s got a solid idea of what I *could* do, but maybe not necessarily what I *can* do,” I say with a shrug. “Like just because I could do something in theory, it doesn’t necessarily mean I can do it in practice. Or at least I’m hoping I can convince him of that.”

“You’re going to, what? Play dumb?”

“It’s worked before,” I shrug. “Do you have a better idea?”

“Kill him?”

“I have no idea if I can, Alex. I’ve never felt anything like that in my life.”

“Well, that’s reassuring.”

“Yeah. I know. After what I felt, I think Peter might have been right about her hiding,” I tell him quietly.

“Do you know what Liam wants?” he inquires, changing the subject. When he sees the confusion on my face he elaborates, “For the war college costume.”

“Oh. No. No clue.”

“Interesting. I can’t believe you let *Amelia* get the drop on you. I’m going to tell Peter,” Alex remarks, grinning.

I sigh. “Yeah, well. Whatever. Tell him Iverson is around, too.”

We fall into silence while we wait for Liam to come back and it’s another ten minutes before I hear him tap on the door.

“Good. You look better,” he says when I open the door, and based on the amount of relief I hear in his voice, I must have looked worse than I thought. I take his free hand in mine. “Here,” he says, tossing a uniform at Alex.

“Perfect!” Alex says enthusiastically. “What do you want for it?”

“Rings for you and Davy,” Liam answers.

“*Two* rings? For *one* costume? Seems like a bit of a lopsided trade.”

“Do you want a second uniform?”

“No. Why do you want rings for me and Davy?”

“Hazel wasn’t going to have you come take care of her head, and if something happens to her…”

“Really, sis? You were going to roll the dice with that head injury?” Alex asks, turning a withering stare on me which clearly indicates he’s reevaluating how intelligent he thinks I am.

“I wasn’t thinking clearly?” I try half-heartedly.

Alex rolls his eyes.

“Yeah, fine. Since my sister’s clearly an idiot,” Alex mutters looking back at Liam. “Davy’s already working on them for you anyhow. Has been since Leisch. Well, except for the time when Christine was around screwing with his head. Anyway. I should be going.”

“Wait a sec. Liam, what did Amelia say?”

“She said she hasn’t done anything either.”

“Damn. Alex, wait here for like fifteen or twenty minutes before you leave?”

“Why?” he asks, clearly suspicious.

“I’m going to go make a scene. I’m going to saturate the whole area in so much magic that hopefully Iverson will have no idea you were ever here, or are leaving. Hopefully it’ll be distracting enough that no one follows you. But still, be careful,” I remind him before I open my door and step out into the hallway.

“You’d better go with her,” I hear Alex tell Liam behind me. “Whatever she’s doing sounds like it’s probably a bad idea.”

### 20 - Ride

“Where are you going?” Liam asks, as he walks alongside me matching me step for step as I climb the stairs.

“To the roof. Do you have the key for the door?”

“Yes, but what are you going to do? You need to keep a low profile, remember?” He reminds me, his voice tight.

“There’s not a whole lot of reason to keep a low profile, now that Iverson is *here*, and has seen me. Right now, I need to do exactly the opposite of that. Don’t worry. Only Iverson will know it was me, and he’s not going to say anything,” I state with more confidence than I feel.

I can tell Liam has doubts, but he unlocks the door once I reach it, and I fling it open and step out onto the rooftop.

“You might want to cover your ears, so to speak. This is going to be loud,” I say over my shoulder.

Liam nods.

I start pulling power into me. A lot of power, as quickly as I can. I use it to pick up the wind speed. Not for any reason other than to burn through it so that I can pull in more. I’m trying to drop the temperature drastically, and I’m trying to use a lot of magic with next to no finesse to do it—all power and no skill. I’m going to drop the temperature across the entire city and blanket the whole thing in snow. Kind of like what I did in Ponchar, but on purpose. So I’m burning through power with that as my only goal.

The temperature is rapidly plummeting, but I want it to dip even more. I can see my breath in the air now, but it’s not cold enough yet to make the snow last overnight.

If I’m right, I’m making such a cacophony right now, that there’s no way Iverson will be able to track anyone else’s magic, regardless of how he’s doing it. The temperature where I’m standing is cool enough, but I want the whole city to be this cold. Fortunately the wind is also cycling the air, so it shouldn’t be too much longer.

Once it’s almost cold enough, I send the temperature plummeting the last little bit when I coalesce the clouds overhead and the first flurries begin to fall. Then I cut it all off.

I’m grinning as I hold out my palm to catch a flake. Snow is wonderful when you don’t have to worry about it killing you.

“What was that?” Liam barks out, as he rushes toward me and grabs my shoulders, worry clear in his slate grey eyes.

I encircle us so that no one listening, assuming anyone is, can hear our conversation. “A distraction. Hopefully.”

“I’ve never felt you do anything like that!” Liam exclaims as he looks down into my eyes.

“Because normally I’m not endeavoring to show off in the stupidest possible way.”

“And you think now is the time to do that? To make yourself a target?” he challenges, with a hint of anger.

“I think,” I explain, holding onto him a little tighter, “it worked on the archery field.”

“The… what? That competition we had?”

“Yes. I made myself a target, and then I trusted Davy and Alex to pick you all off. I bet you guys never even fired a single shot that was anywhere close to either of them, because you were all so focused on me. Same principle. Whatever is going to happen with Iverson, confronting him head on isn’t going to work. But letting him think that’s what I’m doing might.” I kiss Liam gently.

“I—a little warning might be nice.”

“I told you I was going to cause a scene,” I remind him.

“Alex said you guys grew up playing games like this.”

I shrug.

“So, what? Your mom was teaching you asymmetric warfare tactics as a kid?”

“She was… I don’t know. She was making weapons,” I tell him with a sigh. I’ve been saying it all along, and I’ve always thought it was true, but now I think maybe everyone else is starting to get it. “She taught us a lot. All of my childhood was bad, but it was almost all useful too,” I admit. Maybe even the really bad parts.

“And what’s the look that just flashed across your face?”

“What look?”

“Hazel,” Liam rebukes, his voice full of admonishment.

“I think maybe she was teaching us how to break, without being broken.”

“That sounds…”

“Yeah, I know exactly how it sounds. It sounds like I’m justifying what she did. I’m not. She’s a monster. I’m merely saying there may have been value in it.”

Sometimes there’s value in being a monster. It’s a simple fact.

Liam looks at me like I’ve grown two heads. I think Alex would have the same reaction. But I think Davy would understand. I need to talk to him. We need to undo her magic on Liam because I need to talk to her. I never thought I’d be thinking that, but I do, and I’m not willing to chance it while she can use Liam against me. But I need to talk to her, and I need to do it soon.

----

The next few days go by unremarkably, aside from the constant talk of how odd the weather has been lately. If I was a normal person, maybe I would start to feel like everything was going to be fine, but with each day that goes by, I feel like a wire being wound tighter and tighter. I’m almost sure it’s intentional. If Iverson wants to see who’s going to blink first, well. It’s not going to be me.

I need to talk to Davy, but I’m unwilling to draw attention to him by doing so, especially since I know as soon as he thinks he’s got it figured out, he’ll let me know.

So instead, I continue on pretending everything is fine. I show up to the classes I’m supposed to. I do the work I’m supposed to. In the evenings, I’ve been sparring with Amelia. She hasn’t won since that first time. I’ve been spending my nights in Liam’s room since he seems worried I’m going to do something stupid if left to my own devices. I’m not, but I’m also not complaining. It’s better than spending all night awake and alone in my room.

While Liam sleeps each night, I’ve been trying to work out how Iverson knew where I was that first day, and I think I’ve got it. It’s those damn energy meridians. It’s got to be. Nothing else explains it. I bet he can sense them. I proved I can do it to an extent with Lisette. It’s definitely easier the closer I am, but I also bet the bigger they are, the easier they are to feel. Meaning mine are probably the easiest to feel of all. I’ve been trying to feel them out in the nights when everyone else is asleep, and I can definitely feel Liam’s, but he’s right next to me. I feel twinges I believe might be others, much farther away and much dimmer. I think it’s partially because I’m not very good at it—yet—but also because distance diminishes it like it does with every other sense. Meaning he probably can’t find Davy and Alex unless he gets close to them, and if I’m making a bunch of other noise at the same time, he might not be able to even if he’s close.

Liam said Iverson was staring at them with a blank expression the entire time he was reporting to Commander Selby. I bet the majority of Iverson’s focus was on figuring out where I was during the conversation, all so he could get up and walk there like he knew exactly where I was the whole time. It was a bluff. He was showing off. I find the realization oddly comforting.

Initially, it was bothering me that I couldn’t feel General Iverson when trying to feel for the energy meridians around me. I’m not exactly sure where he is, but I’m sure he’s lurking somewhere close by. And based on what I felt in the gym, he should glow the same way I think I do. However, it occurred to me not long after that, that if I can be really loud, I can probably be really quiet. It’s what I’ve been focused on for the past several hours. It’s actively different from not using any magic or not pulling in any power. Even when I’m not doing either of those things, my energy meridians still practically glow. Although, I think I’ve figured out the knack for making them dimmer. I want to see if I can make them go dark, and if I can, can I hold them like that? And what happens if I do? I feel like there could be some negative side effects, but it seems like it could be useful enough to chance it.

Right now I’ve got them like banked ashes and I’ve been holding them there for close to thirty minutes. It takes no small amount of effort or focus, but I’m betting it’s one of those things that gets easier with practice, since Iverson seems to be able to do it almost constantly.

I hear a knock on the door, which startles me, because it’s close to three in the morning and the halls have been silent for hours. But it doesn’t startle me enough to let my meridians flare back up. It does wake Liam up though. He looks at me with his eyebrows raised in question, and I shrug. I fade back into the shadows where I won’t be visible from the door as Liam gets up to open it.

“General Iverson?” Liam asks groggily.

Shit.

“Is Miss Raidane with you?” I hear from the other side of the door.

*Lie. Lie. Lie.*

“Why would she be with me?” Liam questions, still sounding half asleep.

“Because she’s spent every night in this room since you returned.” It definitely sounds like a statement of fact and not a question or an assumption.

*Hah! I’m right.* I grin but make sure to keep everything banked exactly the way it was before he knocked on the door.

“I haven’t seen her,” Liam answers tonelessly.

“Hmm,” I hear, and then the door shuts.

“What was that about?” Liam wants to know when he sees the look on my face.

I hold my finger up to my lips, but say nothing. I gesture to the air around us. Can Liam make a sound shield? I have no idea, but I can’t do it right now without potentially alerting Iverson to what I’ve been doing.

Liam looks confused, so I gesture to the air around us again and point to my ear. I see him realize what I’m asking and he shrugs.

“Fortunately, I’ve seen you do that a lot,” Liam comments, after a moment of concentration.

I resist the urge to jump into his arms, barely. Instead, I fling myself against him, grinning like a maniac. “I’ve got it!”

“Got what?”

“I know how he found me in the gym that day. He just gave himself away!”

I kiss him because I can’t help myself. All this exuberance I’m feeling has to go somewhere, and he’s the only available target. By the time I come up for a breath, I am actually in his arms, and he looks thrilled for an entirely different reason.

“I can’t,” I tell him when he leans in for another kiss. “I can’t do that and this at the same time. Yet.”

“‘This’ being?” he asks, but doesn’t set me down.

“It’s a whole bunch of stuff with energy meridians. I’m going to have to try to teach you—to teach everyone. But I’m pretty sure that’s what he used to find me that day in the gym with Amelia. It occurred to me I can kind of feel them, and I couldn’t think of any other way he could have done it, so I’ve been working on it at night.”

“Instead of sleeping?”

“Yes! I can feel yours when you’re close to me, and I think if I practiced more I could feel them from farther away. I think maybe I can feel others in the distance as well, but I can’t feel his and I know he’s been hanging about, so I figured he must be doing something to hide them. So I’ve been working on doing it, too.”

“Is that why you couldn’t do any magic?”

“Yes! Right now I’ve got them all dimmed down really low, but to do magic I’m pretty sure I’d have to let them go back to normal, and as soon as I did that, he would know I was here, and then he would know I figured it out.”

“So how much focus does it take?” Liam asks as his mouth caresses the side of my neck.

I want to let him keep going. I really, really do but right now I can’t. “Too much.”

“That’s a shame,” he breathes softly across my neck before setting me down.

“Ask me again tonight,” I tell him. “By then I’ll probably need a… harder challenge.”

That earns me an honest laugh.

“Alright. Do you want to start trying to teach me how to do it? I’m definitely not going to be able to fall back asleep.”

### 21 - Just a Girl/Stupid Girl

The next day I’m sitting in the gallery listening to a last minute session about Avonare. The room is reasonably full for something like this, and the number of people lining the benches is cutting down on the echo that’s normally present due to the overwhelming number of hard surfaces coupled with the cavernous ceilings.

The Avonarese Commander has been called in to give a briefing about the return of Avonare Polity’s heir. Evidently, my mother chose this morning to announce she’s back. From the sound of things, she hasn’t mentioned Alex or me, which is good news for both of us, as far as I’m concerned. If she could forget we exist entirely, it would solve about half of my problems.

Earlier this morning she, apparently, summoned the Avonarese Commander to the residence she has been staying in, and requested Commander Melbrin accompany her to Corriven. I haven’t been able to figure out the angle behind her request yet since, on its face, it’s a stupid request. Nothing about my mother’s return is official yet, and therefore Commander Melbrin doesn’t answer to her. The overall discussion thus far has put forth the same argument.

I don’t think my mother’s going to get what she’s asking for, but I also don’t think she ever expected to, so there must be some other reason she was asking for it. But the only reason I can figure she might have, is to cause this exact situation, which doesn’t make any sense to me either. Though I have heard rumors swirling around stating Dairuvar is mobilizing its army near its northeastern border—the one it shares with Avonare. Maybe her decision to suddenly announce her return is related to that. Or maybe she’s behind those rumors. I think both options are equally plausible.

People have been coming in and out of the gallery throughout the discussion—since as far as political gossip goes, this is prime—so when the bench creaks next to me, I pay it no mind. Slowly, I begin to feel a ramp up in the energy around me. It goes from nothing, to a trickle, then a steady flow, to a raging river. I ignore it, and focus on the scene in front of me as if I feel nothing. I know it must be General Iverson. And evidently he’s hoping to elicit a reaction from me. But I know nothing. I see nothing. I feel nothing.

*I know nothing. I see nothing. I feel nothing,* I repeat to myself as I work to look like I’m focused solely on the proceedings in front of me.

Eventually someone calls for a recess. As soon as the statement is made I feel a rap on the wood of the bench. I’ve been expecting it for a while. Nonetheless, I give a slight startle as if I haven’t been waiting for it before looking to my left. When I do, I let my eyes widen slightly in surprise.

“General Iverson,” I say breathlessly, in a tone that I hope makes me sound slightly awed. I note his hair is even darker than my own. I’m guessing it’s the shade mine would have been if my mother hadn’t meddled with my appearance. I think I should probably have some feelings about that, but I don’t.

“Miss Raidane. Are you finding the discussion interesting?” he inquires cooly.

“I—it’s politics, sir. Perhaps I shouldn’t say so, but I don’t particularly see the appeal.”

“Really?”

“Yes. It’s just not my cup of tea.”

“What is your cup of tea?”

“I like oolong.” I pause for a moment. Then give a sheepish smile as I say, “Oh, that’s not what you meant! I, uh, I’m not sure.”

“Where were you last night?”

“Last night?” I repeat, as if I’m confused by the question.

“Yes. After curfew. Where were you?”

“Asleep.”

“Where?”

“In my room?”

“Are you sure?” he asks. “Because I knocked on your door, and no one answered.”

“On *my* door?” I wait, but he says nothing. “I’m a heavy sleeper. I must not have heard you. I’m sorry. Is there something I can help you with now, sir?”

“So you weren’t in Captain Marten’s room?”

I shake my head mutely.

“I saw you sparring in the gym.”

“Last night?” I question, as if I can’t follow the subtext of the conversation at all.

“No.”

“Oh. When?”

“The day you, and the others, returned.”

“Oh. I don’t remember you being there. Sorry. I took kind of a nasty blow to the head that night. I had a concussion and everything,” I tell him, as I rub at the back of my head like it still kind of hurts.

“The weather was very peculiar that night.”

“Oh! That was the night with all the snow! I remember seeing the snow when I woke up the next morning,” I say, nodding.

He’s beginning to look a touch exasperated. I fight the urge to grin, and instead school my face to attentiveness.

“Do you know who I am, Miss Raidane?”

“Yes?” I say with what I hope is more than a fair amount of bewilderment. “You’re General Iverson. I haven’t confused you with someone else have I?”

“Hmm,” he says before getting up and leaving.

I debate calling out ‘Bye!’ to his receding back, but decide not to push my luck.

----

“I saw you talking to General Iverson earlier,” Henry comments, as we sit together at a table with Amelia.

“Correction, you saw General Iverson talking *to me* earlier,” I tell him as I blow on a spoonful of soup.

“Really?” Amelia asks.

“Yeah, he just kind of showed up,” I explain.

“What did he want?”

“Information,” I answer. I’m just not sure if he was looking for information about my mother, or information about me. He definitely didn’t get any of the former, and I hope he got very little of the latter.

Since the end of the session this afternoon, all I’ve heard in every hallway and every room, are conversations about Avonare and the Raidanes. People are wondering where my mother has been for the last three decades, what she’s been doing, and, most importantly, why she’s back now. I’ve heard wild speculation—she was being held prisoner by Dairuvar or Oulanen, she was being held hostage by her own family—as well as more reasonable statements—she had a mental breakdown, she abdicated but then realized the error of her ways. Both flavors of gossip are variously asserting that she’s come back to stabilize the alliance or tear it apart, depending on who’s doing the talking. I’m already finding it exhausting.

“What did you tell him?” Henry questions.

“That I like oolong tea.”

“No, seriously.”

“Seriously. I told him I like oolong tea,” I grin, remembering the annoyance that flickered across his face as I said that. “Do you guys remember the stuff about the energy meridians?” I wonder, changing the subject.

They both nod.

“Can you guys feel yours?” I ask them.

“No,” Amelia says, and Henry shakes his head.

“I need you guys to work on being able to feel them,” I tell them. “It’s important.”

“Important why?” Amelia wants to know.

“I’ll tell you when you figure out how to feel them. See you in the gym later?” I ask her as I stand up to leave.

“Sure.”

----

Iverson shows up that night in the gym while Amelia and I are sparring. Of course he does. It’s good though, because I was thinking he might. Glad to see I was right. I believe I might be beginning to understand how he thinks.

He didn’t drag Liam with him tonight, which also doesn’t surprise me.

The first time he was here, he saw me lose to Amelia. I intend for him to see the same scenario again this time. I expect he’ll do the same thing tonight he did then. Since he saw me react that first night, I can’t pretend like I don’t feel it, but I can act like I have no idea what it is or what the source is. Which is to say, if I’m right and he does it again, I intend to react exactly the same way I did then. Let him think I still have no idea what it is, or that it’s coming from him.

I slow all of my reactions just enough to give Amelia another slight advantage in addition to the size advantage she already has on me.

Iverson has been watching us spar for probably close to ten minutes before I finally feel that same physical rippling sensation that makes the inside of my head feel like it’s expanding in size. Like before, I let myself appear distracted. Like I’m searching for the source.

Amelia goes on the attack, taking advantage of the perceived lapse in my attention. This time, I control the fall as she takes me to the ground. She comes out on top and is able to successfully pin me. It’s a good one. If I was willing to suffer for it, maybe I could get out. But I’m not, so I don’t.

I tap the mat. “You win.”

“Hah!” Amelia says, rising to her feet and extending a hand to pull me up. Amelia likes winning. I don’t mind. So do I.

“Nice,” I comment once we’re both back on our feet.

“Want to go again?” she proposes.

“No, though I was thinking about going for a run if you want to come,” I answer. I don’t want to spend any longer in this gym with Iverson watching me than I have to, and I have a feeling he’ll stick around as long as I do.

As expected, she declines, and I spend the next hour running laps around the inside perimeter of the walls, thinking. Davy really needs to hurry up. I need to get out of this holding pattern.

### 22 - Heat Waves

“Have you heard *anything*?” I ask Liam several days later as we lie in bed together. “From *anyone*?”

I’m getting edgy. It’s been close to two weeks since I’ve talked to Davy or Alex. I know Davy said a few weeks, but not being able to pop out and check up on how things are going is definitely beginning to get to me. This is the longest I’ve gone without talking to Davy in *years*. It’s also the longest stretch I’ve spent inside at night in years, and I’m not a fan of either.

“I talked to Peter a few days ago,” Liam tells me as his fingertips trail up my spine, eliciting a shiver.

“And?” I prod for more information.

I feel Liam shrug beneath me. “Everything was fine.”

“I think we have different definitions of fine,” I mutter.

“Just be patient.”

“Just wait around until something bad happens,” I sarcastically comment, rephrasing what he said to be more accurate. Being here all the time is *really* starting to get to me.

Liam sighs. “It’s Saturday. Would you like to go do something?”

“Yes.”

“Okay, what do you want to do?” he asks, fingers tracing softly across my skin.

“I don’t know. Anything. I feel like I’m dying being cooped up here all the time.”

“Sorry you don’t like being cooped up here all the time with me.”

“I—that’s not what I meant,” I say quickly.

Liam laughs. “I know. I know. I was only kidding. You’re an adrenaline junkie who hasn’t been getting her fix.”

“I’m not an adrenaline junkie!”

“Uh huh,” he remarks, clearly disagreeing.

“I’m not!” I protest.

“You are. Be honest. You feel most alive when there’s a non-zero chance you might die.”

“Doesn’t everyone?”

“No,” Liam answers, before rolling and pinning me beneath him. “This, for instance, makes me feel much more alive than possibly dying does.”

I arch into him. “This makes me feel pretty alive too. It’s just… I need both, I guess. The way my heart races when I’m in bed with you is totally different than the way it pounds when I’m jumping across buildings or climbing something really high. I need both equally, or I feel like something is missing,” I explain, running my hands over his chest.

“I know,” Liam says, then kisses me softly. “I know who you are, Hazel. Shall we go out? We can see who follows us.”

“Could be dangerous,” I whisper.

“I take it that’s a yes, then?”

“Yes.”

----

We walk out the gate like normal people. It’s all very boring. There’s no one obviously following us, so we stop and linger on the bridge for a good while. If I’d thought to bring some bread, I could feed the swans which have recently migrated back. Unfortunately, it didn’t occur to me before we left. More’s the pity. Feeding the swans is great cover for standing around trying to figure out who might be following you. Plus, watching the swans squabble over bread is always amusing.

I let my awareness expand outward, as I search for the energy meridians of anyone who might be following us. I don’t feel anyone except Liam, who’s right next to me, but it would be stupid to assume that Iverson or one of his people isn’t following us. And more likely than not, not all of his people are magic users.

Eventually, we resume walking, taking a circuitous route through the city, and it feels so good to be away from the war college that I halfway toy with the idea of whether I want to go back.

“Anything?” Liam inquires.

“Not that I can tell.”

“But you still think he’s following us?”

“Yeah. I do.”

“Want to go get a drink?” Liam asks, sliding an arm around my waist.

“Yes.”

Ten minutes later, we’re sitting at the bar of a nearby pub surveying the crowd entering and exiting. The pub is dimly lit, with low ceilings, but it manages to feel cozy, rather than claustrophobic. I haven’t been able to pick up on anyone following us. It’s starting to bug me. Both because I don’t like the thought I could be wrong, in which case everything I think about Iverson could be wrong, and also because I don’t like the thought there’s someone watching me who is so much better at what they’re doing than I am. Both thoughts are disconcerting.

Unexpectedly, my ring for Davy goes hot.

“I think we might *finally* have an answer,” I tell Liam as I look pointedly at my hand. Now, I just need to figure out how we can get to Davy without being followed. Without leading Iverson straight to him.

“An answer about me?”

“Yes, I hope so. But we need to figure out how to get to Davy without being followed, and I don’t have a lot of good ideas about how to do that right now.”

“We’ll have to wait until it’s dark,” Liam states. “I’ve been working on being able to dim my energy meridians since you brought it up, and I think I’ve got it.”

“Show me?”

He does, and it’s not perfect. The best way I can describe it is that it feels like light leaking out from underneath a door, but I think if he can sustain it, it’s probably good enough.

“How long can you keep it like that?”

“I don’t know. Probably long enough.”

“Can you do it while walking? Or running?”

“Maybe?”

“Well, I guess we’ll find out,” I comment. “How long until it gets dark?”

“Four hours or so. What do you have in mind?”

“The weather has been very peculiar lately,” I mutter.

“What?” Liam asks, confused.

“Just something Iverson said to me,” I say absentmindedly.

“When?”

“The day my mother officially announced she was back,” I comment.

“You didn’t think that was worth mentioning?”

“No. He was trying to get a reaction out of me, but why not build off of it?” I ask, rhetorically.

“What are you thinking?”

“Fog in the spring isn’t uncommon. Not even really heavy fog. Especially not near the river.”

“You’re going to make it foggy?”

“*Really* foggy. Yeah. If he can’t follow us magically and he can’t follow us visually…” I shrug.

“Won’t he feel you doing that and know something is up?” Liam wants to know, and it’s a fair question.

“Not if I spend the next four hours doing it very, very slowly.”

“Do you know that for a fact, or are you just hoping?”

“Pretty sure,” I murmur, my attention already focused elsewhere, very, very slowly absorbing energy from the air around us and using it to slowly build the conditions for the fog. “We’ll find out soon enough.”

----

It’s been a few hours, and for at least the last thirty minutes everyone filtering in has been remarking on the fog. I’ve probably heard the words ‘pea soup’ more in the past thirty minutes than the rest of my life combined.

“There’s a rear exit,” Liam tells me quietly as he returns from looking around. “We can go out that way.”

“Okay, are you ready?”

“Yes. You?”

I nod.

He holds out his hand and I take it as I hop down off my stool. I let him lead the way to the alternate exit he found. I stop when I see the door in front of us.

“Alright, let’s become invisible,” I say as I wait for his nod before stepping through the door.

Outside, visibility is down to no more than ten feet, even less in some places. If anyone is following us by line of sight they’ll have to be close enough that we’ll know it, and right now they shouldn’t be able to follow by tracking our magic. It’s the best I can do. I hope it’s good enough as I tug Liam into a fast walk. We’re both quiet as we move through the fog.

The Ginnelstreet flat is about three miles away, the fog should last more than long enough to make it there before it begins to dissipate. I keep an eye on Liam as we walk, since I’m truly not sure how long he can maintain keeping his energy meridians dimmed down.

We walk for about twenty minutes when Liam suddenly pulls me sideways against the nearest wall pressing a finger against his lips. I strain to hear whatever it is he thinks he heard that has us pressed up against the wall, waiting. One minute goes by, then another. Liam holds us unmoving, then finally I hear it. A careful shuffling forward. The sound of someone following us. Someone who stopped when we stopped, but is now unsure since we’ve been motionless for so long. Someone creeping along.

Liam releases my hand when he’s sure I’ve heard what he has, and I see a knife in his palm. As soon as the man following us has walked past, Liam moves to slam the pommel of the knife into the back of his head. The man drops.

I search the man’s pockets quickly, but find nothing. I place the tip of my knife against his chest.

“What are you doing?” Liam asks, grabbing my hand.

“You don’t leave an enemy alive at your back. Plus, when he wakes up he’ll be able to tell Iverson the direction we were headed in, which could be enough,” I whisper quickly.

“If Iverson finds the body he’ll know that anyway,” Liam argues.

“Not if you help me get his body into the river,” I answer. I thrust my knife forward and Liam doesn’t stop me, but I can’t help but note the look in his eyes as I do.

I think I might have killed off whatever delusions Liam may have still been harboring about me being a good person. I sigh.

“You take his arms, I’ll get his legs,” I murmur.

Liam nods, and we shuffle our way a couple of streets over to the river where we toss the body in. It makes a muffled splash as it hits the surface.

“Come on,” I whisper, and we resume our trek.

About half an hour later, we’re close to the Ginnelstreet flat and I’m letting just enough power creep back through my energy meridians to warm my rings for Davy and Alex so that they’ll meet us on the street so we can get in. As soon as I’ve done it, I dim them back down. A minute goes by and I see the door open.

“It’s me,” I call out in warning before heading toward the door.

When we get closer I see it’s Alex who’s opened the door. He quickly ushers us inside, locking it behind us.

“All good?” he asks us as we make our way up the stairs.

“We are now,” I answer.

Alex looks at me sharply, so I elaborate.

“We were being followed, and now we’re not.”

“Where’s the body?” he asks.

“In the river.”

“Good,” he responds quickly.

Well, at least Alex thinks I made the right decision. I’m sure Davy will too. I sigh, noting the questioning look Alex is casting between me and Liam.

“What’s up with you two?” Alex inquires, unwilling to leave well enough alone.

“Nothing,” I state.

“Liam?”

“It’s none of your business, Alex,” Liam tells him firmly.

I think I hear Alex sigh, but it’s hard to tell over the sound of my own sigh echoing in my head.

“Give us a minute, Alex,” Liam says, grabbing my arm to stop me when we get to the top of the stairs.

Alex looks between us. I nod and he goes into the flat by himself, leaving us standing alone on the landing.

Liam takes my hands in his. “Just because I need time to think, it doesn’t mean there’s something wrong,” he states.

I resist the urge to shrug and play it off like it doesn’t matter and I don’t care, because it does and I do. Instead, I say nothing. But Liam waits me out, seeming to know that there are always at least a hundred separate thoughts racing through my head.

“I can’t possibly conceive of a world in which needing time to think doesn’t mean there’s something wrong,” I respond.

“I know.”

“So when you say you need time to think, what does that mean?”

“I haven’t figured out yet if there’s anything wrong,” Liam answers.

It hits me like a punch in the gut, and I take a step back. Then another, until my back is against the wall. “I… should I stay here tonight?”

“Do you want to stay here tonight?”

I open my mouth to answer his question but then close it. “That’s not fair. You asking me that question—that’s not fair. If you don’t want me around tonight, tell me.”

“I—” Liam begins but then hesitates.

“I’ll stay here,” I respond quickly, as I walk through the door.

### 23 - Here

In comparison to when I was last here, the flat is practically cheery. They’ve managed to add a couch and a couple of chairs since then, and it’s starting to feel like people actually live here. I’d probably like it if my mood wasn’t plummeting in a manner equivalent to a long drop followed by a sudden stop.

“Hi, Davy,” I say as I enter the room. I don’t wait for acknowledgement before asking, “Can I stay here tonight? And no, Alex, I don’t want to talk about it.”

Davy and Alex exchange a glance, and I swear I hear Liam sigh behind me, which feels unfair since he’s the one who apparently wants some space.

“Sure,” Davy answers neutrally.

“Thanks. You have an update about the key?”

“You mean this key?” Davy asks as he pulls a key out of his pocket. A key which is definitely not the same key as the one in Alex’s hand.

“You did it? It works?” I ask, grinning.

He nods. “Yes to both.”

Before I can think better of it, I fling myself at Liam, who catches me, rejoicing, “He did it!”

“Yes, I heard,” Liam responds before slowly setting me back down.

“Well, it’s not that bad, then,” I hear Alex comment from behind me.

“Shut up, Alex,” I tell him as I turn back to them. “How does it work?”

“I was right in thinking the original key and locks had been forged from the same piece of metal—and I think that was done via magic too—so they had a preexisting tie to each other. Then magic was used to reinforce the connection, so that the locks could only recognize the key which had been made at the same time. It’s not just the shape of the key, or the magic, or the metal. All three are required for it to function.”

“That doesn’t explain how you got it to work.”

“I’m getting there,” Davy informs me, as he sets the key down on the table. “But you need to hear the background.”

“Why?”

“*I’m getting there.* This is important.”

“Okay, okay. I’m all ears.”

“Do try to be,” Davy replies, and I think I hear a touch of sarcasm in his words. “So the shape of the key, you obviously took care of when you made it, and the magic reinforcing the ties between the locks and the key I was fairly sure I could replicate pretty easily. It was the last part which was the problem.

“I’ve spent the last couple of weeks on that bit of it. I’ve been very, very slowly… convincing, I guess you could say, the key you made that it wasn’t made last year, but at the same time as the original. Convincing it—as much as you can convince a piece of metal, which is more than you might expect—that it was the *same*.”

“Huh. Sounds painstaking.”

“Yes.”

“And…” My stomach drops.

Apparently my face does too, because Davy nods and affirms, “Yes.”

“Does someone want to clue me in?” Liam questions, having remained silent up until now.

“In a minute,” I answer, as I wave him off. “Let me think.”

I can’t undo the magic on Liam. If the sameness of the object is crucial to the magic, it would require more or less the inverse of what Davy did to the key. I would have to fundamentally change either Liam or my mother, and there’s no way she’s going to sit there and allow me to do it to her, and there’s no way I *will* do it to Liam. Plus, doing so would make the magic completely unstable and who knows what would happen then.

Shit.

“I can’t undo it,” I tell Liam, finally. “Undoing it would require changing who you are in a very fundamental way. Basically, I’d have to make you into someone different, which I honestly don’t even think I could do, and even if I could, I wouldn’t. Not to mention it would all become incredibly unstable in the process, and would probably kill you before I could finish it.”

Liam’s expression is carefully neutral.

“It’d be like trying to undo what she did to Alex and me,” I mutter.

*Oh. Damn. No.* Those last thoughtless words give me an idea which induces near instant nausea and a rising sense of panic.

“I need to go outside,” I declare, grabbing one of the keys off the table and practically running to the door that goes to the roof.

My hands are shaking as I stab the key into the lock, nearly missing the keyhole. I need to be outside *now*. *Nownownownow,* the voice in my head is screaming at me. I yank the door open and it smashes against the interior wall. But I don’t have time to care about that because I’m already running out onto the rooftop. I make it about five steps before the nausea overwhelms me and I’m emptying my stomach onto the roof.

“Hazel?” Liam questions softly from the door.

The sound of his voice kicks off a new round of vomiting that has me folded in half. Finally it recedes and I manage to choke out, “I can’t… I… I can’t talk to you right now. I just— Can you wait inside? Please?”

I hear him retreat, and then a minute later I hear Alex’s footsteps approaching. “You should probably get Davy too,” I tell Alex as I stand and go over to the wall, sliding down it into a sitting position.

“Davy, can you come out here? Bring that bottle of whiskey I picked up earlier,” Alex states.

“Do you have anything stronger?” I ask. “Maybe some ether? Laudanum, perhaps?”

“Liam, don’t leave,” Alex orders, ignoring me.

“Wasn’t going to,” I hear from further inside.

Great.

Davy comes out carrying an unopened bottle of whiskey. I practically snatch it out of his hands. I’m raising the bottle to my lips as soon as I manage to uncap it. The glug as the whiskey flows from the bottle is almost identical to the one I make as I gulp it down.

Finally, I lower the bottle and wipe my mouth with the back of my hand. “Did you realize?” I question Davy, and it comes out sounding accusing. “Before I said it. Did. You. Realize?”

“Yes,” he responds flatly.

“And you?” I ask Alex in the same tone.

“No,” he answers, shaking his head. “I’m still putting the pieces together.”

I thump my head back against the bricks of the wall. The fog remains incredibly dense and I can’t see the stars at all. It feels appropriate. I drink some more. I want to empty this bottle so that I don’t waste all of the whiskey when I smash it against the wall. Or Davy’s head, even though it’s not his fault. Not really.

“You wanted me to find you a solution,” Davy says by way of explanation. “I found you a solution. I didn’t say it was a good solution, but I think it is the *only* solution.”

“Can someone catch me up?” Alex asks.

“Go ahead,” I gesture for Davy to explain, while I drink some more.

Davy sighs, then looking at Alex, elaborates, “You know Alexandria made you both more like her, but she made Hazel *a lot* more like her. I don’t know if it’s simply that she got better at it after practicing on you, or because they’re both female, I’d guess it’s probably a combination of the two, but it doesn’t really matter. Anyway, Hazel is very similar to Alexandria, and Alexandria’s magic is targeted at herself and Liam. But Hazel might be similar enough to Alexandria and powerful enough that she could convince Alexandria’s magic she is Alexandria, and transfer it from Alexandria to herself.”

“Or I could make myself more like her. Like you said, I’m close enough already that doing it probably wouldn’t kill me,” I add, saying the quiet part out loud.

“Let’s hope that’s not necessary,” Davy states.

Alex looks like he’s quickly understanding my earlier reaction. “Davy, that’s…”

I nod.

“You wanted a solution,” Davy repeats. “You don’t have to use it. If I thought there was another way, I’d have led with that.”

“I know,” I respond quietly, because I do.

“I’m going to talk to Liam for a minute,” Davy tells us.

Alex sits down next to me and takes the bottle from my hands and takes a drink of his own. We sit together in silence. Presumably, we both want to hear what Davy has to say to Liam.

“She’s not mad at you,” I hear Davy inform Liam distantly. “She’s mad at me. I think they both are now.” He sounds tired.

“Why?” Liam queries.

“I’ll let her tell you. If she wants to.”

The conversation from inside falls silent.

“What was that about earlier? With you and Liam?” Alex asks me.

“Liam thought we should’ve left the guy following us alive. And I didn’t.”

“Leave him alive? That’s stupid. You never leave an enemy alive at your back.”

“Yeah,” I agree. “Liam didn’t like my approach. He told me he needed time to think, and when I asked if I should stay here tonight, he asked me if *I* wanted to stay here tonight, which is bullshit and I told him as much. Then he *hesitated*, Alex. He *hesitated*.”

Alex passes the bottle back. “That’s… rough.”

I nod, and begin picking at the label on the bottle.

“He’s going to want to talk to you before he leaves.”

“I know,” I reply, making no move to go back inside despite feeling the dampness from the fog seeping through my clothes.

“I’m going to send him out here,” Alex tells me as he rises to his feet, giving me the chance to object, but I don’t.

A minute later Liam comes and sits down next to me. I don’t say anything. I merely lean my head back against the wall again and close my eyes.

“What happened earlier?”

“I had a sudden, unfortunate realization,” I answer obliquely.

“About me? Since my voice was enough to set you off…”

“You were part of it. Yes,” I say, as my fingers continue to pick at the label on the bottle.

He doesn’t push me for details and instead lets the silence settle between us, which I appreciate. With the fog surrounding us, it’s easy to forget about the rest of the world. It’s a shame it can’t last.

“Can we talk about earlier?” Liam asks, eventually.

“What about earlier?” I probe, warily.

“Will you tell me what you think happened?”

“Why?” I question. I don’t have it in me to hear about how I should have let Iverson’s man live.

“I think we may not have the same understanding of what happened.”

“We were both there,” I say. I don’t want to rehash it.

“Humor me? Please?” Liam implores, placing his hand atop mine.

“I killed someone, and you didn’t like it.”

Liam sighs. “I thought that might be it.”

“That *was* it,” I protest.

“No, Hazel. I don’t care that you killed him. I was trying to determine if there might be some way we could have used him to our advantage, but you killed him *before* I had the opportunity to figure it out. That you settled on a course of action so quickly, without discussing it with me or giving me the opportunity to weigh in, is what I have an issue with.”

“I…” I begin, but I don’t know how to respond to that. I guess that could be an accurate assessment of what happened.

“And since I was sitting in there, with more time to think about it,” Liam tells me when it’s clear I’m not continuing, “I think your assessment of the situation was correct. But we were *both* there, Hazel. The situation wasn’t urgent. You could have waited a couple of minutes for me to reach the same conclusion, or for me to suggest another idea.”

“Okay,” I answer slowly. “That’s fair. But why did you hesitate when I asked if you wanted me to stay here tonight?” There’s more than a hint of hurt in my voice. Even I hear it.

“Because I was trying to figure out the answer to your question,” he says, sliding closer to me so that his body is pressed alongside mine. “I just needed more than half a second to figure it out. Same as out on the street.”

I sigh. “Sorry. I’m not good at waiting. Or uncertainty. Clearly.”

“I know. So do you want to tell me what you realized?”

“I can’t undo it.”

“Yes, you said that already.”

“But I might be able to… modify it. Move it so that’s not binding you to her but to me. You remember a while ago how I mentioned she made me and Alex more like her?”

Liam nods.

“Davy and I both think she might have made me similar enough to her that I could basically convince her magic I’m her, and move it to me.”

“Based on your response, I take it there’s more to it than that?”

“Because that’s not bad enough?” I hiss in disbelief, before continuing. “There’s a chance I might not quite be similar enough but that—given how similar I already am—I could *make* myself similar enough without dying in the process.”

“Ah.”

I nod. “Davy doesn’t think I’d have to, but honestly neither of us knows. We’re making semi-educated guesses based on a fucking key.”

“So what do you want to do?” Liam asks me. “It sounds like you’ve got more at risk than I do.”

“I mean, we could *both* die. Definitely a non-zero chance of death for you, me, and my mother if I don’t get it right or if it doesn’t work the way I think it will.”

“What do you want to do, Hazel?”

“I want you to think about it overnight tonight. Because if I do this, and it works, your life is tied to mine forever, and if I do it and it doesn’t work, you’ll probably die. And I want you to think it over *without* me. Go downstairs and stay with Peter, or whatever,” I order, and the irony is not lost on me.

### 24 - Number One Crush

The next day comes all too soon. The dawn is cloudless and seems extra bright when compared to the fog of last night. I wish it wasn’t here.

“Did you sleep?” Alex inquires, as he walks out onto the roof and hands me a cup of coffee that’s still steaming.

“Not really.”

“Are you going to do it?”

I sigh. “If Liam’s okay with it, yes. I can’t let her have a leash on me that she thinks she can use to yank me around whenever she feels like it. Probably the only reason she’s held off this long is because we’ve been at the war college, and Iverson has been there too. Long term, not doing it will be worse.”

Alex nods, sipping at his coffee. I’m not sure if he agrees with me, or if he’s merely indicating he’s listening. I also don’t know if I care.

“What do you think Liam is going to decide?” I ask Alex.

“I think Liam would rather be chained to you than her.”

I snort. “You make it sound so appealing.”

Alex shrugs. “Liam would die for you, sis. And I don’t know. Sometimes it seems like you would throw your life away because it’s Wednesday and you’ve got nothing better going on, but I think Liam is one of the few people you would *trade* your life for. The real question is do you think you can do it?”

“You know me. Full of hubris,” I say softly.

“But do you think you can do it?” he asks seriously.

“Yes.”

The only real question is how much of myself I’ll have to give up to do it. Or how much I won’t. I don’t know which thought is worse—that I’ll have to become more like her, or that I’m already so much like her it won’t matter.

“What are you going to do about Iverson?” Alex probes. “Seems like this is definitely the sort of thing he’d be able to feel.”

“Yeah. It does.”

I spent a good chunk of the night thinking about it. We can’t do it here for obvious reasons. Doing it on the campus would be equally problematic, since Iverson could come bursting in at any moment and even if he didn’t, he’d have a pretty good idea what was happening and who was doing it.

“Do you think they’re still watching Davy’s flat?” I ask.

“Hard to say. We’ve been back for weeks and no one’s been back there, so maybe not.”

“I can’t think of a better place,” I admit. “Iverson presumably already knows about it, so we wouldn’t be giving anything away by doing it there, and though it might not be much, maybe it will help to muddy the waters a little bit. Could be me, but it could also be you or Davy.”

“Well, if we do it there, we could all go for brunch first. Maybe send Gavin and Giorgi around to check it out before we show up,” Alex suggests, shrugging.

“Yeah. Where is Davy, anyway?” I wonder, taking a sip of my coffee.

“He went down to talk to Peter and Liam.”

“And we weren’t invited?”

Alex shrugs.

“Are you still mad at him?” I pry.

“Mad might be overstating it, but yeah. I’m somewhat irritated he didn’t mention anything at all.”

“You know how Davy is,” I shrug. “He tells you what you need to know, when you need to know it.”

“And that doesn’t bother you?”

“No, not really. Not usually. It’s Davy. I appreciate that I can tell him something and know he won’t repeat it to everyone without me having to explicitly tell him not to. Unlike some other people I could mention,” I add with a deliberate glance sideways at Alex.

“You’re both so reticent,” he sighs.

“Well, lucky for you, you have a way around that,” I remark.

“I think the two of you are *why* I have a way around that,” Alex states. “Besides, it’s not the same as having someone tell you what they’re *actually* thinking. It’s more… fleeting impressions, most of the time.”

“Huh.”

“What?”

“It’s an interesting perspective is all. I never thought of it like that.”

“Well, you wouldn’t have, would you?”

“I don’t know,” I answer truthfully.

“I know you don’t like to hear it, Hazel, but it really is different for you than it is for the rest of us. You expect the world to bow to your demands, and it does in ways the rest of us could never dream of.”

I shrug and seriously debate whether or not to share the next thing I’m thinking, but ultimately I decide to.

“You know how I’ve always said I never wanted any of this?” I ask.

Alex nods.

“After the pass, when I woke up, you were all gone. I found Davy unconscious and I was so weak I could barely get him onto my horse. Then, to find out she’d taken Liam… I spent so much magic—so much of myself—keeping us all alive during the pass that I was too weak to do anything about any of it for that first day. I couldn’t do *anything*. It made me realize, maybe for the first time, what being powerless would be like. I think I’d like that even less,” I admit. “And that realization scares me, because I always thought all this power was something I could do without. Something I would willingly give up if I could. But now, having felt that, I don’t know if I would actually be willing to give up *any* of it.

“And I really don’t like knowing that about myself. It makes me feel more like her, and less like I can trust myself at all. Then when you factor in that I already risked Liam’s life on nothing more than a guess that she wouldn’t kill him when we all left, and the fact I’m willing to do it again now…” I trail off.

Even though it’s something I realized a while ago, and have been thinking about a lot, saying it out loud to another person—even Alex who’s not that different from me—makes me feel vulnerable, like I’m showing off the parts of myself there’s something wrong with.

“It sounds like this is a conversation you should be having with Liam and not me,” Alex tells me. “But I think that’s just who you are. Who you’ve always been. You take chances, Hazel. It’s like you said yourself, you’re full of hubris. Although, I’m not sure you can call it hubris if you’re always making good on it,” he says before walking away.

----

A little while later, Davy comes back with Liam in tow.

After a few minutes of hushed conversation between Alex and Davy, which I’m sure has a lot to do with me and Liam, Davy says, “Alex and I will meet you two at the cafe with the others in an hour and a half or so.”

“Have you decided?” I question Liam once the door shuts behind them.

“Yes.”

“Okay, well, before you tell me what you decided, I want to talk for a minute,” I tell him as I take a seat at the table and nod for him to do the same. Once we’re both seated, I blurt out, “I don’t know if you should trust me.”

“Why?” he asks slowly.

“You remember after we got off the ship, and my mother almost killed you?”

He nods. Of course he remembers. I’m just stalling.

“When you woke up, you asked if everything was okay, and I said we could talk about it later, but there was never a good time for later.” I sigh. “And I didn’t want to talk about it. Mostly the second part. Only now I think we should.

“I wasn’t sure,” I admit. “I wasn’t sure she wasn’t going to kill you. Killing you wasn’t the logical choice. There was nothing to be gained by it, but she doesn’t always make the logical choice. I told you I was sure because I *wanted* to be sure, but probably also because I wanted to get off that ship and I wanted you to come with me. I’ve always known I was willing to gamble with my own life, but it’s mine to do with what I want, so I’ve never had an issue with that. But I am, evidently, also willing to gamble with *your* life on a maybe, and I don’t particularly like that about myself. I feel like you should know before you make a decision.”

I sigh, but force myself to continue. “I’ve also always thought I would give up all this power if I could, but after the pass and what happened afterward, I don’t know if that’s true. Actually, that’s a lie. If I’m being honest, I don’t think I would, which is not something I want to admit to you. Or anyone.” I hate it. I hate that this is who I am.

Liam’s face gives nothing away, and he says nothing for several long minutes. Finally, he tells me, “No one *ever* gives up power willingly. Lots of people like to say they would, but when push comes to shove they don’t. Usually they try to grab more power at that point, and hold onto it tighter, while continuing to tell themselves they’re not the kind of person who would do that.”

He leans back in his chair, drumming his fingers across the table top. “I would say I think that makes you normal, but you realize you’re unlikely to give it up, which is more than most people can say. You’re also not trying to actively cultivate more power for yourself, which you certainly have plenty of opportunity to do if you wanted.”

“I think you’re giving me too much credit. I think *everyone* is giving me too much credit,” I mutter.

“And I told you before that I don’t think you give yourself enough credit. That you should trust yourself more. If you want people to walk around being scared of you, which I don’t think you do, you’re going to have to be a lot scarier. And since you’ve spent your whole life getting a masterclass on it from your mother, I’m pretty sure you know that, and it’s not what you want.

“But if you want to hear me say I’m sorry no one else is as scared of you as you are of yourself, I won’t.”

My mouth drops at his last words. “I’m not… I don’t… That was a dick thing to say!”

“It’s true,” Liam states evenly.

“You have no idea—”  I begin.

“No, you don’t get to tell me I have no idea when I’ve spent the past six months watching you crucify yourself, Hazel. When I told you yesterday that I know who you are, I meant it. I know exactly the lengths you would go to and it doesn’t scare me.”

“Then you’re an idiot!” I want to shout it at him, but I’m so tired. “And you have no idea. None. None of you do,” I can’t explain it but I’m certain it’s true. Everyone thinks they know who I am and what I’m capable of, but how could they possibly know when I’m not even sure myself?

“Are you done telling me what I know?” Liam challenges.

“I don’t know. Are you done telling me who I am?” My tone is brittle and angry and it fully reflects how I feel. How I’ve felt since last night. Since Liam pointed out I don’t always think to include him when I make decisions affecting both of us. Since Davy reminded me of what my mother did before I was even born. Of who I am. Of our sameness.

“Probably not,” he responds.

I think I’ve had it with everyone. With the entire world. I shove my chair back from the table and stand up because I feel like I’m going to explode, but Liam grabs my wrists.

“Ask me why,” he urges as he stares me down.

“I don’t care why!”

“Ask. Me. Why.”

“Fine. Why? I’m waiting with bated breath,” I retort sarcastically.

“Perhaps we all tell you that we think you’re a good person because we think you’re a good person, but more importantly because we think you *need* to hear it. It’s possible you don’t give *us* enough credit. Maybe we all realize exactly how easy it would be for you to *stop* being a good person. So we tell you to remind you. To give you expectations to live up to.”

“That’s asinine!”

Liam releases my wrists and shrugs. “Are you done being mad yet?”

“No! I’ve barely even gotten started!” I shout back at him, and I don’t think I’ve ever said anything in my life which has felt more true.

“Well, how about I tell you my terms before you storm off?” Liam proposes, with a gleam to his eye that both intrigues and annoys me.

“Your *terms*?” I spit back at him.

“Yes,” he tells me evenly. “I have terms. Maybe you don’t give *me* enough credit, Hazel.”

His last statement takes a little bit of the wind out of my sails. “What are you talking about?”

“I don’t particularly like being tethered to your mother or allowing her to use me to control you. But don’t think for even a second that I think your reasons for wanting to undo it are altruistic.”

Ouch. That stings a little bit. Mostly because it’s so incredibly accurate. I slowly sink back down into my seat.

“Okay,” I respond begrudgingly. “Go on.”

“You want to do this because you don’t want her to have power over you. Her connection to me gives her power over you *because* you love me. But long term, you and I both know you would sooner we both die than let her use me to control you, because your love for me wouldn’t survive that.”

I think he’s wrong about that last statement, and that’s what really scares me. That’s why I don’t want her to have that kind of power over me. I would die for Liam, but I would also kill for him. Probably for Alex and Davy too. I would raze entire cities to nothing more than smoldering ash. That’s why she can’t have that kind of power over me.

My mother and I have been locked in a quiet stalemate since Leisch. She can’t kill Liam because I’ll kill her if she does, but there’s only so far I can stretch that, because she knows I won’t stand there and watch Liam die, so if she wants to call my bluff, *really* call it… Well. Knowing her, that’s why she wants me and Davy in Dairuvar.

But I don’t tell him any of that, I merely say, “Perhaps you underestimate my love for you.”

“Perhaps,” he agrees shrugging, “either way, I want this, but you want it more.”

I nod, it’s true.

“So I have terms. I want you to do this, but I want you to make it bi-directional when you do. You die, I die. I die, you die. Plus, it should give you a little peace of mind.”

I look at him questioningly.

Seeing my confusion, he says, “Back in Leisch you said you wanted a failsafe. A way someone could take you out if it all goes wrong. Congratulations. You’re getting one today.”

“I—no. I don’t want that.”

“Oh? Did you have someone else in mind?” Liam inquires facetiously.

“No. I just—no.”

“Those are my terms. Take them or leave them.”

I want to reject them, but he’s right. I need this. I need it so much more than he does. I need him to be safe from her. And I need to talk to her. And I need a gods damned failsafe. I need all of it.

“Fine. Deal,” I agree, as I stand back up and extend my hand toward him.

He clasps his hand around mine, and uses it to pull me closer to him.

“I’m still mad,” I inform him as he wraps his arms around me.

“I know.”

### 25 - Gold Chains

We meet up with Alex, Davy, and Peter at the cafe.

“Hi, Hazel,” Peter says to me, while nodding to Liam.

“Hi, Peter,” I reply, trying to be polite, if not friendly, as I take a seat at the table.

“Gavin and Giorgi are doing a walk-by of Davy’s flat,” Peter tells us as we sit down.

“Okay. Good. How long have they been gone?” I inquire. I’m wondering if I can get away with going to check up on them. Not because I think they need checking up on, but mostly because I don’t want to be here. I’m angry—not at anyone in particular, just at the situation. I’m also not hungry, and I don’t feel like sitting still. I definitely don’t feel like making small talk with anyone.

“Only a few minutes,” Peter answers.

I sigh and order a cup of coffee.

“I met with your father the other day,” Peter informs me.

“Really?” I ask. I’m not surprised they met, but I’m surprised Peter is telling me.

“Yes. He wanted to know what my impression of you was.”

“What did you tell him?”

“That it was hard to say, other than that you didn’t really seem to like me much.”

I snort at that.

“Did you seriously play as dumb as he made it sound like you did?” Peter queries.

“Hopefully. Did he buy it?”

“I think he’s withholding judgement at the moment.”

“I can work with that.”

“He’s not going to keep withholding judgement when he finds the body in the river,” Liam mutters.

“If,” I say, correcting that statement.

“Problem?” Peter asks.

“Liam didn’t tell you?”

“No.”

“We were followed last night. So I made it so that we were no longer being followed.”

“Well,” Peter states slowly. “Liam is probably right. He’s suspicious by nature, so it’s not going to bode well. For either of you,” Peter looks at Liam as he says the last part. “He knows you two are… very involved.”

“Great. How much does he know about Alex and Davy?”

“The subject didn’t come up, and I wasn’t going to mention it.”

I nod.

“But fair warning in any case, if you killed one of his people he’s probably going to stop treating you like a puzzle and start treating you like a threat, regardless of whether he finds the body or not.”

I shrug. “We were bound to get there anyway.”

I don’t like it, but it’s true. Regardless of whether or not he thinks I’m the village idiot, if he actually believes the nonsense my mother was spouting, it was always going to end badly for me. It’s hard not to have a defeatist attitude about the whole thing.

Liam reaches over and takes my hand, running his thumb over the back of my knuckles. “We’ll figure it out,” he tells me softly.

I nod, but I’m not sure there’s any solution that doesn’t end up with all of us dead.

“So what does he want from you?” I ask Peter.

“The usual. Information. For me to keep an eye on Liam. To figure out what you’re up to, if I can. But since I told him you don’t exactly trust me, he’s probably not expecting much there,” Peter elaborates.

“You should tell him you ran into us here. He’s going to know we were in the area anyway.”

Peter nods.

“And tell him, I suppose, that we were up to something, but I wouldn’t tell you what,” I supply with a shrug.

“I have done this before, Hazel.”

“Don’t remind me.”

Giorgi and Gavin slide into seats at our table.

“Looks fine,” Gavin tells everyone. “Doesn’t seem like it’s being watched.”

Giorgi nods in agreement.

“Good to see you guys,” I say to both of them.

I have actually missed hanging out with them. I want my life back. I want to be able to see people without having to worry that doing so is going to turn them into targets, but I’m not sure if I’m ever going to be able to do that again.

I need to shake myself out of this funk. I gain nothing by being moody and sad about my situation. If anything, it’s going to reduce my ability to find solutions to the problems I’m facing.

Step one would probably be eating something, since it’s been close to a full day since I’ve had any food.

“Did you guys already order food?” I ask.

“I ordered for you both,” Alex says, answering my real question.

“Thanks. So what’s new with you guys? Anything exciting?”

“No, life is boring without you around, Hazel,” Gavin comments morosely before Giorgi starts laughing, and Gavin breaks into a grin as well.

Sitting together at the table with everyone, eating and talking, almost makes me feel normal for a second, which in turn makes me realize how on edge I’ve been over the past couple of weeks. It’s hard to be happy when you’re walking on eggshells and looking for threats in every shadow.

----

An hour later, Davy, Alex, Liam and I are back in Davy’s flat for the first time in months. I miss this place. I miss being here before everything started falling apart. I throw myself onto Davy’s couch. Liam sits down next to me.

“Are you ready?” I ask him, knowing he is and dreading it at the same time.

He nods.

“You’re going to have to be fast, sis,” Alex reminds me. “Once she realizes what you’re up to, she’s going to fight you.”

“I know.” I’m stronger, but this is her magic. She knows exactly how it works, and I’m merely guessing, with brute force and surprise being my only real advantages—and considering I don’t think I’m *that* much stronger than she is… I really don’t have much of an advantage at all.

“Don’t forget about Iverson,” Davy adds softly. “If he realizes you’re up to something, who knows what he’ll do. He may try to interfere.”

I nod. “Okay. Liam, move down to the end of the couch.” I wait for him to get situated before lying my head on his lap, using his leg for a pillow. “Stay there and don’t move. I have no idea if you’ll feel anything, but hopefully not.”

“Okay.”

I close my eyes and focus my attention on Liam, trying to pick out the areas where I can feel my mother’s magic layered across him. When I finally pick up on it, I realize it’s been right in front of me the entire time. It’s covering him like a spiderweb—clinging and practically invisible until the light hits it just so. It’s massive, and it trails away from him, back to her, I assume.

This would be a lot easier if I was doing it from her side of things, and I could simply try to pick it up off of her and move it onto me. But that will never happen. I think this is going to be a lot messier than I was hoping. I’m slightly less sure the outcome is going to be positive, but not enough to stop me from trying it anyway.

Hubris.

The best I can do is look at how it’s clinging to Liam, and guess what it looks like on my mother’s end. I’m going to have to hold that guess firmly in place as I grab onto the magic and pull it to me really, really hard, really, really fast before I slam it into place and hope for a good outcome. Hope that I got it right. Hope that it’s close enough. Hope that *I’m* close enough.

Awesome.

I don’t bother to mention any of this to anyone else before I start working. It doesn’t matter. There’s nothing they can do about it. There’s nothing I can do about it. There’s nothing *anyone* can do about it. It’s just going to suck, like so many things in life do.

I map out the entire web of magic clinging to Liam, and as I do, I’m trying to figure out the directionality of it all. How does it bind him to her, but not her to him? If I try to duplicate the pattern I see on him it won’t work. I’m sure of that, but I don’t know what the pattern on her end looks like.

I don’t think my original plan is quite going to work. I’m going to have to rely upon the fact that, according to everyone else, I can make reality bend to my will, and I’ve never quite believed they were right. In fact, I’ve always been pretty sure they’re wrong. But in the end, it’s all just energy. If I can slide the idea of me that is most like her into the web stretching between them, and then I pull ever so slightly, I might be able to snap it from her to me. Hopefully it’ll be like a magnet, and since in that analogy I’m both the stronger magnet and the closer one, it will work. Maybe. There will probably be half a second of pure agony, followed by some amount of disorientation, but if it works, and I’m still conscious, then I can do whatever is required to make it bidirectional.

If. *If* it works. If we don’t all die. There’s nothing to it but to do it.

I think about all the parts of me which are most like her—not only the physical similarities. All the parts of myself I typically try to lock away and pretend aren’t there. All of the parts of myself I like least. The parts that make me unlike a normal person. The parts of me that are willing to burn the world down to get exactly what I want. The parts of myself that let me slide a knife into a person’s chest, and toss a body into a river like it’s a piece of flotsam. The parts of me that think of the people I love as my possessions, as things that *belong* to me. And it’s this last one that I crystalize my self image around.

I know she thinks of Alex and me as possessions that belong to her, rather than as individuals with our own desires and motivations, and I build my sense of self out of all of it, but mostly that Liam is mine and not hers. He belongs to me, and if there’s any magic that’s going to cut his life short, it’s going to be *mine*. My person. My magic. All of it is mine.

I hold this version of myself front and center as I begin to force my way into the spider web of magic I sense coming off of Liam, until I’m right in the center of it. So far, I haven’t broken or changed anything. Everything that connects Liam to my mother is intact. But now I’m going to give one hard tug on all of her magic, and hope it snaps to me like a magnet. If I’m right, and it does, it won’t even require that much power because she already did that part. Iverson might not even notice. It’s simply going to hurt. Probably a lot. And I’ll have to hold it there until it stops. At least it should hurt me more than it hurts Liam. I think.

I take a deep breath, and let it out. In and as I breathe out, I pull. I probably use more power than I need to, and I’m sure she’ll have a comment about that later, but I want to be sure. I want it, and I let myself have it.

And then the screaming starts. Me. I’m the one screaming. I’m not surprised and I pull the pain in closer and closer, holding it tight to me so it doesn’t spill onto Liam. It’s not slowing or stopping though, and holding the magic in place as it burns me from the inside out is all I can do. I can’t even separate myself from the pain.

“Help her!” I hear Liam yelling.

The screaming stops, but the pain doesn’t. Actually, I’m still screaming, it’s just soundless now.

“Whatever you did, it didn’t work. She’s still in pain,” Liam asserts.

“No shit,” Davy mutters, “but no one can think over the sound of that.”

“So you just stopped the sound?” Liam asks, and he sounds aghast.

I’d laugh if I wasn’t so busy silently screaming. Sometimes I don’t think Liam understands any of us at all. I don’t think the pain is lessening, but even I’m relieved not to hear the sound of it.

“Yes. Alex, see what you can do about the pain. Liam, either shut up, or talk to Hazel. Hazel, as much as you can, you need to let me in. I can’t help if I can’t see what’s happening.”

I hear his words, but right now, I don’t have the ability to do it. Or the ability to tell him that. Or anything else.

“Hazel,” Alex says, “I know you’re trying not to let it spill over onto Liam, but you need to let it or we’re not going to be able to fix it. And if you don’t let it go, it’s probably going to happen anyway. How long do you think you can keep this up?”

‘As long as I need to’ is *always* the answer, but I can’t say that right now, either.

“If you don’t let it,” Alex threatens, “I’ll drug you and we’ll see how well you manage then. How much of it do you think will spill over onto Liam? I bet it will be a lot.”

Fuck. He’ll do it. I know he will. I’d do the same if our positions were reversed. It’s the logical decision. I hate it.

I release the grip I have on the pain, and I swear I can almost feel it moving along the bond between Liam and me, and he starts to scream too, before Davy does the same thing to shut Liam up as he did to me.

It frees up precisely enough space that I can lower my shields a fraction for Davy and Alex.

Davy looks between me and Liam a few times, his gaze lingering longer and longer each time it lands on me.

“Damn, Hazel,” he finally mutters. “You’ve really botched this. What Alexandria did to him looks like needlework. What you did to yourself looks like a giant knot. If you give me two weeks maybe I could fix it, but you’d both be in agony the entire time.”

“Alex,” Davy sighs, and jerks his head away from us.

They leave us screaming silently on the couch while they have a discussion out of my field of vision. A few minutes go by and I hear footsteps on the staircase followed by the sound of the door opening and closing.

Then Davy comes back to the couch and crouches in front of me. I want to ask him what he’s doing—I can’t though, because I can’t do anything other than try to control the agony I’m feeling—but I’m afraid I already know.

----

I’m not sure how much time passes before I hear the door open and close, followed by two sets of footsteps.

Fuck.

Alex comes into my field of vision first. Followed by my mother. Of course. Who else could Davy possibly send for? And I know this was his idea and not Alex’s.

“Alexandria, I need you to help me fix this,” Davy tells her.

I see her flick her eyes to him, but she says nothing.

“Mom,” Alex growls, and I note he now has a knife at her back, “you *will* help us fix this.”

“Why would I ever want to do that, Alexander? Your imbecile sister got herself into this mess. I see no reason to intervene now. Actions have consequences. If she didn’t want to feel them, she shouldn’t have been so stupid.” She looks at me. “Does it hurt, daughter? It looks painful. You were close. So very close. If only you weren’t so impatient, maybe you could have figured it out.”

I’d spit on her if I could, and part of me very much wants to tell her I’d rather suffer this agony than accept her help, but I can’t because all I can do, assuming Davy even lets me make a sound, is scream.

“Help them, or so help me, I’ll kill you myself,” Alex tells her.

She rolls her eyes, and I can see Alex fighting the impulse to apply a little bit of forward pressure to the knife in his hand.

“Alexandria,” Davy says, “I think he means it. If you help us, I promise that neither Hazel, Alex, nor I will attempt to harm you or interrupt your plans—as long as they do not involve us—now or at any future date.”

“That’s an awfully big promise you’re making on behalf of my children, Davy,” she remarks thoughtfully. “Are you sure you speak for them?”

“Yes,” Davy confirms.

The same rules as always apply. The same rules we’ve all agreed upon. Davy makes the decisions the second he decides he makes the decisions.

She looks at Alex and waits.

“Yes,” Alex mutters frustratedly.

“Very well, I will help.”

“To be clear,” Alex begins, “in this context, ‘help’ means you will fix the magic on Hazel, you will not rebind Liam to you, and you will do nothing to Hazel other than fix that magic.”

“Yes, of course,” she agrees.

“Anything else makes the agreement null and void,” Alex emphasizes.

“Obviously,” she responds, with more than a hint of annoyance.

Davy comes over carrying two chairs, which he sets in front of us, and he and my mother both sit and begin working.

Several minutes go by, and eventually my mother hisses sharply, “No, not there. Not like that. You’re barely any better at this than she is. It’s a *weaving*, Davy, not macrame.”

The skin around Davy’s eyes tightens but he only nods, and they continue working in silence.

The light I can see outside tells me we’ve crossed the threshold into late afternoon, and my mother and Davy are still working. I think the pain has lessened enough that I would no longer be screaming. I could probably even move if they would let me, but Alex’s magic is locking me in place. Liam too, I assume.

Late afternoon is trending toward evening, and it no longer feels like I’m being burned alive when my mother waves Alex’s magic away and says to me, “You wanted this to be bidirectional, yes?”

I nod. I’ve been staring at her for the past several hours, and as always, I find it disconcerting. It’s like looking into a mirror and seeing exactly how I’m going to look in twenty years.

“Very well. It will allow me an easy way to kill you, should I so desire.”

I roll my eyes because I still can’t speak.

“Done,” Davy says, looking to my mother for confirmation.

“Done,” she agrees. “I can’t believe you thought you could thrust your way into a weaving, daughter,” she says derisively.

Finally I feel Davy’s magic evaporate, and I snarl, “I. Have. A. Name. And I was trying to be quick. I can’t reconstruct a *weaving* quickly.”

“Perhaps you should have practiced, then. It’s like I’ve taught you nothing,” she notes, rising.

“The stuff with the energy meridians, did you teach it to Iverson? Or did he teach it to you?” I demand.

“Which do you think, daughter?”

“I think you taught him, but I think he’s better than you at it. I think he’s better than you at *everything*,” I remark, trying to bait her.

She shrugs noncommittally, and then asks, “The snow and the fog?”

I think for a moment. “If I tell you, I want a favor.”

“I just did you a favor.”

“No. You did Davy and Alex a favor. I would have *never* called for you. I would have figured it out eventually,” I assert with far more confidence than I actually feel.

She snorts in response, but doesn’t go so far as to tell me I’m wrong. “Very well.”

### 26 - Closer

Liam and I slowly walk back to the campus. At the rate we’re moving, dusk will have crossed into true night by the time we get back, but neither of us has it in us to hurry, given the way the day went.

I did everything wrong, and I know better. My mother was right when she said I deserved what I got. Liam didn’t deserve to share in that torture though. I’m honestly surprised she helped at all. I think eventually I could have figured it out, it just would have taken days for me to be able to fight through the agony enough to do it. Days I didn’t have. She was telling the truth when she said binding me to Liam gives her an easy way to kill me. But I don’t think that’s enough to explain her decision, which worries me. I feel like I’m trying to put together a puzzle but some of the pieces are missing, and I don’t know how many because I don’t even know what the puzzle is supposed to look like when it’s done.

Then there’s also the fact that, apparently, Davy and I were right. I was already similar enough to my mother. I didn’t have to change myself in order for her magic to accept me as her, despite the mess I made. Normally I like being right, but not today. Not about this. It feels like my stomach started dropping the second Liam agreed to the idea this morning, and it hasn’t stopped since.

Everything that happened earlier was my fault, and I’m angry at myself for being so recklessly impulsive.

“I’m sorry,” I tell him as we cross the bridge to the north bank of the river. “She was right. I should have been more careful. I shouldn’t have rushed it. I should have spent days working on it before I did what I did.” They’re the first words either of us have said since we left Davy’s, and my eyes look at everything but Liam as I apologize.

“Let’s stop for a minute,” Liam responds after a few steps.

“Why?”

“If you remember, I like to have face to face conversations,” he reminds me, as he pulls me toward the side of the bridge.

I let him, but I lean over the railing to stare at the water once we’re there. “That’s exactly what I was trying to avoid,” I mutter.

“I know,” he says as he wraps his hands around my waist, and turns me toward him.

“What are you—” I start, before he lifts me up to sit on the bridge’s parapet, bringing us nearly eye level with one another.

“Face to face,” he tells me softly, his hands still around my waist.

I sigh, but meet his eyes, only inches from my own. “I’m sorry,” I repeat. “It wasn’t supposed to hurt you. You shouldn’t have had to bear the consequences of my actions. You believed me when I said I could do it, and I was wrong.”

“Hazel,” he begins, and I think I hear frustration in the low rumble of his voice as he pushes back the hair that’s fallen into my face. “You told me we could both die. I was never under the impression you were sure it would work. *We* knew it was a risk, and *we* decided it was worth it anyway. Both of us.”

“I don’t like being wrong.”

“You don’t like *losing* and you feel like you lost,” Liam states.

I consider it for a second and realize he’s right. I do feel like I’ve lost to my mother.

“I think,” he says, his thumb stroking along my cheek, “that you probably came out ahead.”

“We’ll find out tomorrow, I guess.”

“Mhmm,” Liam hums, his pupils having dilated so wide I can see my reflection in them in the remaining light that’s being scattered off the surface of the river. His eyes feel like whirlpools pulling me in and I find myself unable to look away.

“We should go back,” I whisper.

“We should,” Liam agrees, but neither of us moves to do so.

Instead, Liam moves closer, and I let him. He wraps an arm around my waist, pulling me to the edge of the bridge’s parapet and into him. It’s all the invitation I need. My lips are hungrily upon his. I throw my arms around the back of his neck to draw him in even more. He nips at my bottom lip, drawing it beneath his teeth before releasing it, and I moan softly.

Finally, I force myself to pull back. “We should go,” I repeat.

Liam nods and lifts me off the parapet, setting me back on the ground, but doesn’t step away.

“Did you…” he trails off.

“Did I what?”

“Nothing. Never mind.” He slides his hand to the small of my back. “Let’s go.”

----

It’s dark by the time we walk back through the gates, but well before curfew, not that it applies to Liam. It does to me though, and I am, at least in theory, still supposed to be on my best behavior. We’ll see how much longer that’s enough to hold Iverson at bay. We’ll see what tomorrow brings, but at least for tonight, things *should* be okay.

Liam’s hand is still on my back as we both head toward his room. He hasn’t stopped touching me since the bridge, which I’m not complaining about since I don’t exactly want him to, but it is a little distracting, which is possibly why I fail to realize we’re quickly approaching General Iverson, until we practically run into him.

I lurch to a stop in time to prevent a collision and Liam drops his hand from my back.

“General Iverson, sorry!” I say quickly. “I didn’t see you.”

“Miss Raidane,” he says cooly. “Where were you this weekend?”

Standing across from him in the hallway, I note he’s about the same height as Davy, making him shorter than average, like me. His personality seems to more than make up for it, though. He also looks substantially younger than he is, like I thought the first time I saw him at a distance. He looks even younger than my mother, and she looks younger than she is as well.

“Visiting family.”

“And you, Captain Marten?”

“The same, sir,” Liam says.

“So you were not together all weekend?”

“No, sir,” I answer.

He stands in front of us in the center of the hallway, blocking us from proceeding and looks between us saying nothing.

“Can I help you with something, General?” Liam asks when Iverson continues to block our passage.

“Yes, Captain. Come with me.”

I step to the side of the hallway as Iverson brushes past me, dismissing me. Liam meets my eyes before glancing to his room as he turns to follow Iverson. The intent is clear—he’ll meet me there when he’s able to. His hand brushes across mine as he retreats back the direction we came from, following Iverson.

I seriously debate following them, but it occurs to me Iverson might want to see if I do. So I don’t. Instead, I continue to Liam’s room to set my stuff down, and then go take a shower.

When I’m done, and lying alone on Liam’s bed with damp hair, I begin to examine what my mother and Davy did. She and Davy were both right. It’s like needlepoint. It’s delicate and precise, and exactly the sort of thing I hate doing. Exactly the sort of thing I always try to brute force my way through. I can’t help but sigh. I guess I need to suck it up and start practicing.

I note spots where it’s woven through and around my energy meridians and I think the loops around them are what she did to make it so that if Liam dies, I die. I think the strands which run through them mean that if I die, Liam also does.

It’s basically the same principle as the snares Giorgi showed me. Pull on them from one direction and strangle Liam. Pull on them from the other and strangle me. It’s clever and it’s elegant. I hate it.

Great. Now every time I do something dangerous, it’s not solely my own life I’m playing with. I let my magic move across the strands binding us together, and it feels like it creates a harmonic vibration not entirely dissimilar to what Iverson did.

I lie there staring at the ceiling for a while, evaluating my options when suddenly I feel the ghost of a thrumming echo throughout my body and jolt upright.

“What the hell?” I mutter, redirecting my focus inward. Everything looks… normal. Or at least whatever this new normal is. Once again, I let my magic move across the strands stretching between Liam and me, and I feel the same humming sensation.

Much quicker this time there’s a thrumming that spreads throughout my body in response. Fuck. This is… fuck.

The room suddenly feels claustrophobic, and I need to get out of it. I go out the window. It’s the quickest way outside and onto the roof. Once I make it onto the flat midline section of the roof I begin pacing. This is *so* not what I signed up for. I feel the need to crawl out of my skin. It’s like my body isn’t my own anymore. I don’t know if this is normal, but I don’t like it and it certainly doesn’t *feel* normal.

I wish I had someone to talk to. But no one can come to me and I can’t go to anyone else. That leaves Amelia, who I don’t fully trust, and Henry, who I like well enough, but this definitely isn’t the kind of thing I want to discuss with him.

It’s too late to do anything about it. Literally. Metaphorically. But still. I wish I’d *known*. Finally, I give up on the pacing. It’s not helping anyway. I lie down on the roof and stare up at the stars. I think Liam realized it on the bridge. Or realized *something*, at least. But I was too busy being annoyed that I botched it to notice at first, and then too distracted by him to realize it after that. Damn.

I’m not sure how much time has gone by. I’ve lost track, but I think I’ve been lying on the roof for a few hours, at least, trying to reconcile the fact that the magic tying me to Liam is so much deeper than I realized. It doesn’t just bind our lives and deaths to one another, it’s… more. I don’t even know how much more. I feel like I should have been given a manual. Some kind of instructions. I have a strong feeling this may not be normal, but my mother is the one person who is liable to know, and she probably wouldn’t give me a straight answer even if I could ask her.

The only reason I’m sober is the tremendous lack of any kind of alcohol on this campus, which I’m beginning to view as a serious problem. Unfortunately, tonight is not the night to rectify it.

Eventually, I give up and make my way back to Liam’s room. He’s still gone, so I crawl into bed alone and try to force myself to fall asleep. Apparently, I’m successful because I’m woken by the bed sinking and Liam wrapping an arm around me.

I nestle myself into his embrace. “You knew on the bridge,” I accuse groggily.

“I felt something, but I didn’t know. Not really.”

“Why didn’t you say anything?”

“I was going to, but then…” he sighs and I feel him shrug behind me.

“What time is it?”

“Almost four in the morning.”

“You smell like smoke,” I comment.

“Sorry,” he apologizes, pulling away, “I’ll go shower.”

“No,” I grab his arm to stop him from leaving. “Stay. What were you doing?”

“Nothing good.”

I find myself suddenly much more awake, and I turn to face him.

“Nothing good like…?”

“I think Iverson was trying to make a point.”

“A point like…? What happened, Liam?”

“He set fire to some barges on the river.”

“Why? What kind of point is that making?”

“Nominally, because their port of registry didn’t originate in Branton, and they weren’t registered with the port authority, making them ‘potentially dangerous to the citizenry,’ which is bullshit. I got the impression the real point was directed at me. There was no other reason for me to be there. I’m guessing he may have expected you to follow. I think he was hoping you might react if you did,” Liam comments, running a hand through my hair.

“Huh.” Would I have reacted? Or would I have sat in the shadows and watched the barges burn? Hard to say. Flip a coin. “Was anyone hurt?”

“Not yet,” Liam sighs.

It’s clearly just a matter of time. Dairuvar doesn’t want an alliance. They’re going to do something to break it. We're basically waiting for Iverson to decide how he’s going to do it. So far, I’ve had the impression the one thing stopping him is the public backlash, but clearly that’s no longer a deterrent. The rumors about Dairuvar now have its army amassed at both its borders with Avonare *and* Leira, though so far I think they’re merely rumors. However, it doesn’t mean they’re not true.

“Well, tomorrow should be interesting,” I say drily.

“Yes,” Liam agrees, trailing his fingers over the bare skin of my upper arm, and goosebumps spread across my skin in response.

“Earlier on the bridge, what happened?” I question, as I move a little bit closer, since he seemed to have noticed something I didn’t.

In response to my question, Liam kisses me. His mouth is soft on mine at first, but I sense the heat behind it, and as I tilt my head for a better angle, his intensity grows, and I press into him matching it. His lips part and I don’t need any additional invitation, my tongue is sliding over his. His hands move down to my waist and then around my hips as he pulls me closer, and I moan softly against his mouth.

He pulls away suddenly and says, “That.”

“What?” I ask, confused.

“You didn’t feel it?”

I shake my head.

“Pay attention to the magic stretching between us,” Liam orders before quickly bringing his mouth back to mine.

I try not to be distracted by the sensation of his tongue stroking over mine, and his hand gripping my ass as his hips press into mine, but I’m quickly losing focus to the feel of his body against me. He moves onto his back pulling me on top of him, and I feel every hard line of his body beneath mine. His hand moves up to caress my breast. The thrill of the sensation has me arching into his palm, moaning. Somehow, I’m still paying enough attention that I see it this time.

The magic between us flares, evidently in response to my desire for him. I pull back suddenly, gasping. I’m leaking magic. My cheeks go hot as I jump to my feet, moving away from the bed, from Liam.

I hear my mother’s voice in my head mocking me: *‘You clearly still can’t manage your power adequately.’* Fuck. I don’t know if I’ve ever been so embarrassed in my life. My breathing is coming in rapid, ragged gasps now for all the wrong reasons. I reach for the wall to brace myself. A small, rational part of my brain is trying to tell me I’m hyperventilating and I need to slow my breathing, but it’s definitely losing the battle as I hear her words echoing in my head.

Liam’s standing in front of me, his hands are on my shoulders. I didn’t even see him move.

“Hazel?”

I close my eyes as I fight to regain control, but the lack of visual reference only makes me dizzier. If it wasn’t for Liam’s hands on my shoulders, I probably would have fallen into the wall or the desk by now.

I shake my head. I can’t. How could I not have noticed? Am I like this all the time? What is going on?

“Hazel, calm down and talk to me,” Liam says, sliding his hands down my arms until his hands are wrapped around mine.

“Am I always like this?” I blurt out.

“Like what?” Liam asks evenly.

“Wrong. Am I always wrong?” I question, desperately. Liam’s words were laced with precisely enough magic to take the edge off, but I’m still steps away from a full blown panic attack.

“What do you mean?”

“She said I couldn’t manage my power, and here I am leaking it onto you and not even noticing because I’m… excited,” I finish lamely.

Liam laughs.

“Don’t do that!” I demand, as I yank my hands from his.

“Hey, wait,” he responds quickly. “I’m sorry. I wasn’t laughing at you, I promise.” He enfolds me in his embrace. “And no, I don’t think you’re always like that. Or at least today is the first time I felt it. So no, I don’t think she’s right and no, you’re not always wrong. I think this is new and it probably makes it a lot easier for it to happen. It’s like adding a new spigot to a water pipe.”

“I—I’m sorry. I had no idea.”

“Don’t be. It feels… nice.”

I don’t say anything. I’m embarrassed. I can’t believe I didn’t notice. It’s seriously mortifying.

Seeing my reaction, Liam sighs. “Here,” he says, tilting my chin up so that I’m looking at him. “Let’s try something, okay?”

He waits a moment, and when I don’t offer any objections, he lifts me up, pinning my body between his hips and the wall, and he brings his mouth to mine, kissing me gently at first, giving me the chance to pull away. When I don’t, his teeth nip at my bottom lip, and his hand moves under the shirt I was wearing to sleep. As always, his hands on my bare skin feel like fire, and my hands wind into his hair as I wrap my legs around his hips. Somehow, despite there being no space between my back and the wall, or my chest and his, he pulls my shirt free from my body. I moan as the pad of this thumb strokes over the sensitive skin of my nipple, instantly bringing it to a hard peak.

Then I feel… everything all at once. It’s a flood of sensation across my entire body. Like Liam and I are existing, momentarily, in the same body. It’s a mixture of physical, magical, and emotional sensation melding together unlike anything I’ve ever felt before. I think I’m experiencing his feelings for me and mine for him at the same time. It’s all blending together into a pleasure that’s just this side of pain, but oh, gods. It feels so good.

When it finally ebbs, my whole body feels limp. I would be in a puddle on the floor if Liam wasn’t holding me up, and he still has all of his clothes on.

“What did you do?” I ask.

“The same thing you did, only intentionally and—I think because it was intentional, instead of spillover—more. Like I said, it feels nice,” his mouth twitches into a half smile as he says that last part.

“That was *more* than nice,” I respond. “I’ve never felt anything like that in my life.”

He shrugs, and it’s hard to tell in this light, but I think he might be blushing.

“Can you stand?” he inquires.

“I have no idea. Carry me? I want to finish what we started.”

That’s all it takes for him to spin us around and move to the bed. My mouth is on his neck, my tongue and teeth working across the sensitive flesh near the base of his jaw. He tastes like salt and smoke, and I want more. I’m pulling off his shirt as soon as my back hits the mattress, and he helps me by removing his pants. Immediately, I’m wrapping my hand around him, stroking him. His eyes flutter closed as he groans.

I’ve never wanted anyone the way I want Liam, and I’m pretty sure the feeling is mutual. It terrifies me more than any physical danger ever could which, in turn, excites me.

He lowers his weight onto me slowly and the mattress sinks as his hands find mine and bring them above my head, pinning them to the bed. He drives into me with one quick thrust, wringing a shout from me. I roll my hips to meet his on the next thrust and we begin moving together, though he keeps my hands pinned. His mouth is on mine, and I feel every hard line of his body brushing against me.

I begin to let my feelings for him bleed into the magic connecting us, and I feel him gasp. I stroke my tongue across his and deepen the pressure of my mouth as I lightly feed more energy into the magic binding us together—this time on purpose.

“Hazel,” he groans above me, pausing.

“I want *all* of you, Liam,” I breathe, as I meet his eyes, and it feels like I’m falling head first into him.

He hesitates.

“*All* of you,” I reiterate.

“If you keep that up, this is only going to last another minute or two,” he says raggedly.

“I don’t care. I want you *now*.”

That’s all it takes. He’s thrusting into me uncontrollably, and I think we’re both feeding energy into the magic binding us, and it’s ricocheting back and forth between us the same way the agony was before, only now it’s ecstasy.

A shout escapes from him as he comes into me, and the fullness coupled with the sensation already passing between us pushes me over the edge, and my body is writhing beneath him as I orgasm too.

We stay entwined for several minutes, both unable and unwilling to move.

“I love you so damn much,” Liam murmurs next to my ear, barely above a whisper.

### 27 - You Should See Me in a Crown

I’m stepping out into the hallway, pulling Liam’s door closed behind me when the door to the left opens. I pause, surprised.

“You know these walls aren’t that thick?” an annoyed voice queries.

“Hi, John. Yeah,” I say somewhat abashedly. “Sorry about last night. We’ll, uh…”

“Be quieter?” he suggests.

“Yeah. That.”

He nods and walks off down the hallway.

Probably half of this wing heard us. I sigh, and begin making my way to the cafeteria while I wait for the inevitable to happen.

Liam left earlier, after getting a couple of hours of sleep. I’ve been awake since he got back, studying the magic binding us together. Trying to understand it better, since so far it’s done nothing but surprise me. I think I have a basic grasp of it now, but I’m sure there are layers to it, and there’s a lot I don’t know yet.

And while there are clearly some… benefits, so to speak, I’m not exactly thrilled about it. At some point, I’m actually going to need to try to speak to my mother to answer all the questions I have related to this, as well as a slew of others, like what the fuck she was doing with Iverson and the others forever ago. She seems to be the catalyst for everything that’s currently in motion, and I get the feeling she knows so much more than she’s even hinted at, let alone shared.

I’m kind of hoping to find Amelia, before whatever’s going to happen, happens—which isn’t something I thought I’d ever find myself thinking a few months ago. Part of me was kind of hoping Liam would be around, even though I know, logically, it’s probably better if he isn’t.

I’m dreading today.

I don’t see Amelia or Henry when I enter the cafeteria, so I grab a cup of coffee and a pastry and sit down alone. I slowly pick at the pastry more out of a sense of duty that I should eat something, and not because I’m actually hungry.

I’ve been sitting in the cafeteria for about twenty minutes when the tenor of the conversations around me begin changing like ripples spreading outward across the surface of a pond. People begin filing out of the cafeteria, and others begin trailing after, curious to find out what’s happening. I take that as my cue and follow them, blending in.

They’re all moving toward the main gallery—the largest one, with the most seating. By the time I enter, all of the seats on the main floor are filled, and from what I can see of the balcony it looks equally full.

I stay standing against the back wall, immediately to the right of the door. Nothing is happening yet, but word has seemingly spread widely that *something* will be happening soon, and I guess no one wants to miss out.

Commander Melbrin files in finally, followed by my mother, who walks past me without so much as a glance in my direction. Damn. I didn’t expect her to come herself. I was anticipating her summoning Commander Melbrin and forcing her to deliver the message, like she did when she requested an escort.

That was stupid of me. *Of course* she showed up. *Of course.* She’s going to cause a scene. Be dramatic. Vengeful. It’s her bread and butter. Of course she wouldn’t pass up an opportunity like this.

I sigh. In for a penny. I make sure my face is expressionless by the time she reaches the front. Someone is going to figure it out. Probably lots of someones.

Finally, General Iverson and Commander Selby enter the gallery and head to the front where my mother and Commander Melbrin are already waiting.

The quiet stretches across the hall. Everyone is eager to hear what’s going on.

“Alexandria Raidane, of Avonare, and Commander Melbrin are here today with an accusation of espionage and a failed assassination attempt by Dairuvar and General Iverson against Alexandria Raidane,” Commander Selby states, pitching his voice to carry.

I make sure my face still betrays no expression as he finishes with his first statement. I see a dark haired head begin scanning the room before finding me. John. He looks at my mother again, and then back at me before refocusing on the proceedings at the front. I see several others scattered throughout the room doing the same thing.

I don’t move. I don’t make eye contact with anyone. I barely breathe. Despite that, the whispers start, and the head turns begin to ripple through the crowd as people find me and point me out to others.

Now that they’ve heard the name Raidane and seen my mother at the same time, they’ve realized I’m not just *a* Raidane. I’m one of *the* Raidanes. I knew this was inevitable. When I asked her for a favor, I merely accelerated it. But I still don’t like it.

I dig my nails into the palms of my hands, but I don’t acknowledge any of the looks currently directed my way. I remain unresponsive and unmoving.

General Iverson follows the stares of the others around the room, and his eyes finally bore into mine, and I see the wrath underlying his gaze.

My mother steps forward. She doesn’t address the other Commanders in the room. She doesn’t care about their decision. She’s already dismissed them. Instead, she addresses the crowd. She’s going for hearts and minds, apparently.

“On Saturday evening, I encountered a man in my residence, looking through my papers and personal effects. Upon confronting him, he attacked me. I was knocked to the floor, and he had a knife at my throat when one of my guards intervened, and killed the assassin. Upon searching his body, I found a Dairuvaran signet ring,” she says holding up a ring, which she passes to Commander Selby after pausing for a few seconds to allow the crowd to take it in.

Commander Selby inspects it, and then hands it off to Commander Graham, who does the same before passing it on.

I wonder if it’s Christine’s ring. If not, I wonder how she got her hands on it.

“You all know about Dairuvar’s hostility. It’s why I have returned. Someone needs to stand against Dairuvar and General Iverson,” she angles her body toward him somewhat, as if she’s ready to confront him now.

His eyes tighten slightly in response to her calling him out by name.

“I came back to be that person! To help Avonare! To help the Allied Polities!” she cries.

She’s really getting into this. I want to roll my eyes, but I force myself to remain impassive.

“General Iverson knows this! He understands the threat a strong Avonare, united with the other polities, poses to his goals, and he tried to have me assassinated to prevent that from happening! This cannot stand! I call for him to be removed as the commanding General of the Army of the Allied Polities, a position he never should have been permitted to assume given his ties to, and standing within, Dairuvar. If his actions are permitted, we all know it will not be long before he declares war on the other polities and uses the Allied Army to do it!”

She’s definitely got the crowd with her right now, and I think she’s doing it all without any magic. I’ve never seen my mother put on a performance quite like this. I’m almost… impressed, as much as I hate to admit it.

The crowd shifts slightly around me, and Liam steps into place beside me, his upper arm brushing against my shoulder, as he folds his arms across his chest. His face is expressionless, but I can tell he’s angry. I’m just not sure why.

The crowd begins murmuring, discussing my mother’s accusations. General Iverson steps forward, biding his time, staring silently at the crowd waiting for them to quiet.

Finally the murmuring begins to abate, and General Iverson clears his throat. “Despite what Alexandria Raidane claims, I know nothing of these accusations. No one from Dairuvar has been sent to interfere with her, and *certainly* no one from Dairuvar has been sent to interfere with her at my direction,” he pauses, and the force of his personality keeps the room silent as he does so. “I don’t know where the ring she presented came from, but it was not from anyone with ties to Dairuvar.”

*Bold claim, that,* I think to myself.

“I further reject all of the… *accusations* she has made about my intentions, and the intentions of Dairuvar. No one respects the alliance more than Dairuvar, and *certainly* not someone who has been… absent for the last three decades, letting her own polity fall into disarray.” General Iverson steps back, obviously feeling those statements should speak for themselves.

I can’t say I disagree.

The crowd looks torn. He made some valid points, but *everyone* knows what my mother said about Dairuvar is also accurate. And she brought props. Everyone loves a good show and tell.

“We will reconvene tomorrow, after we have all had a chance to discuss these allegations among ourselves,” Commander Selby announces to the room.

Conversations immediately breakout everywhere, and it’s seconds before the room is practically an indecipherable roar.

I stay pressed against the wall, where I’ve been the entire time, motionless, as people begin to filter out of the room. Liam scowls at anyone who looks like they’re going to try to approach me, which I appreciate. The last thing I want is to talk to any of these vultures that are about to start circling.

### 28 - Help, I’m Alive

I let the room empty before I even think about moving. By the end, the only people left in the room are Commander Selby, the visiting Commanders of the armies of the Allied Polities, my mother, and General Iverson. Liam left after everyone else did, still looking angry, but I didn’t have a chance to find out why.

Commander Selby made note of me, evidently drawing the logical conclusions. It’s about to be a new world for me. I’m the only person at the war college whose mother is an heir to one of the Allied Polities’ ruling bloodlines—not any bloodline either, but the Raidanes—and now everyone knows it. Now everyone knows who I am. No more blending in. No more fitting in. No more pretending to be like everyone else.

Great.

After a few more moments of observing the conversation between Commander Melbrin and Commander Selby, my mother begins making her way toward the exit. Toward me. I sigh internally but school my expression into one that hopefully looks neutral, if not pleased to see her.

“Hi, mom!” I say, deliberately loud enough to carry. I already told General Iverson I was visiting family, so let’s give him the impression we’re chummy.

“Hazel!” she says, finally using my name without having to be reminded.

She wraps her arms around me in a simulacrum of a hug, and I have to fight the urge to grimace and shove her away.

Clearly she got the memo.

“I’m so glad you were out when the attack occurred! It was dreadful! I would have been beside myself if you’d been injured!’

Now, I’m fighting the urge to laugh. There’s no one in the world who would care less if I was injured.

“I know! I’m so glad you weren’t hurt!” I exclaim as we exit the gallery. As soon as the doors close behind us, I throw up a shield to stop our conversation from being overheard. “I need to talk to you,” I tell her, dropping the friendly facade.

“I’m busy, daughter. Make an appointment,” she replies before walking away.

“That’s what I’m trying to do right now!” I call after her.

My only answer is a shrug from her retreating back.

----

I’m sitting in a class which is *supposed* to be about tactics, but somehow the discussion has veered off onto the topic of supply chains. It’s always gods damned supply chains. Always. Except today, the professor is having a hard time keeping everyone focused on that, which normally—for reasons completely beyond my understanding—isn’t a difficult task. People here typically *want* to talk about supply chains and logistics. But not today.

Today, heads keep swiveling to me. I’m doing my best to ignore them. I remind myself I knew exactly what was going to happen when I asked my mother for a favor. Okay. Maybe not *exactly* but I knew this wasn’t an unlikely outcome, and I still decided it was worth it. I decided that having her provide a reason to Iverson why the man he had following us wasn’t coming back, was better than having his absence, and presumed death, placed at our feet. While Iverson might suspect Liam and I were involved, my mother absolutely threw enough doubt into the equation that there’s no way he can be certain. And maybe, based on his past interactions with her, he even believes she’s solely responsible for it.

*Everything that’s happening right now is happening because I decided the benefits outweighed the costs,* I continue to remind myself.

Professor Daly sighs loudly. I’m in the back of the room near the center of the last row, and even I can hear it.

I meet his eyes. *Sorry*, I mouth.

He shrugs slightly, then gestures for me to approach the front of the room where he’s leaning against a desk.

I resist the urge to shake my head and stay where I am. Instead, I brace myself, and then I stand and walk down the aisle between the student desks.

“Best to get this over with now,” he says to me softly, before addressing the others again. “This is your classmate, Hazel Raidane. The daughter,” he pauses to glance at me.

I nod tightly.

“Of Alexandria Raidane of Avonare Polity. Presumably, since she has been in this class with the rest of you the entire time, and never mentioned her family connections, it’s not something she’s interested in discussing,” he states, glancing at me again.

Once again, I nod.

“Other than you all now knowing her mother’s name, nothing has changed. So perhaps we can keep the whispering to a minimum?”

Professor Daly nods at me, and I begin walking back to my seat.

“But where was she?” someone calls out. “For all those years, where was she?”

“On holiday,” I answer noncommittally, earning a spattering of laughter around the room.

I sit down and Professor Daly tries to pick back up on the supply chain narrative he was discussing before. It’s slightly more successful and there are somewhat fewer heads turning to look at me as the class progresses.

Other people love discussing logistics. I think it’s because logistics are merely talking about doing things. Not actually doing them. If there’s one thing I’ve learned since being here, it’s that people *love* to talk about doing things. They always seem to like the actual doing of them far less, so tactics become logistics.

----

I’m in the gym sparring with Amelia once again. Or trying to, but suddenly there are three times as many people in here as there would be any other night. I know they’re all only here because I’m here. I’ve suddenly become interesting. I hate being interesting.

“Have you seen Liam recently?” I ask Amelia quietly, as the two of us sit against one of the walls, waiting for some of the crowd to piss off.

“Not since this morning. Why?”

“No reason.”

“Uh huh,” she says skeptically.

“When I saw him earlier, he seemed angry,” I explain, “and Liam doesn’t really do angry, generally speaking. I didn’t get a chance to talk to him because of…” I wave my hand at the room. “And I haven’t seen him since.”

“No clue. Did your mother seriously accuse General Iverson of trying to assassinate her?”

I snort. “Yeah.”

“Man. I wish I’d been there,” she comments wistfully.

I’m surprised she wasn’t. It seemed like *everyone* was there. “Where were you?”

“Nowhere,” she responds quickly.

“Nowhere like…?” I wait but she says nothing. “Nowhere like with Peter?” I guess.

She winces slightly. Got it in one, evidently.

“I know you’re not his biggest fan—” she starts.

“I don’t care who you sleep with, Amelia,” I tell her. “It’s really none of my business.”

“I gave you a hard time about Liam, though,” she states softly.

“I think you actually gave Liam a hard time about *me*,” I remind her, “which was kind of shitty of you. But whatever. How long have you two been back together?” I inquire disinterestedly. I don’t truly care, I’m merely trying to steer the conversation toward something that doesn’t involve me.

“We are *not* back together,” she informs me decisively.

“Okay.”

“I still don’t really trust him,” she admits.

I want to say, *Who does?* but the answer to that seems to be everyone but Amelia and me, so I don’t bother. I simply nod.

“But to answer your question, since that night you all got back to Branton.”

“Damn.” I let out a low whistle. “That’s a long time to not be back together.”

She shrugs.

The room isn’t looking quite as full since we’ve been sitting against the wall not doing anything interesting. And by ‘we,’ I mean me. I don’t think anyone is here because of Amelia.

“Shall we?” I question, nodding toward the mat.

“Yeah,” she agrees.

As we take positions across from one another on the mat, I hear someone ask, “Can I spar with the winner?”

I look around trying to find the speaker before my eyes finally land on a woman who’s about the same size as Amelia and a couple of inches taller than me. I want to tell her no, but I look at Amelia instead. She shrugs.

“Fine,” I respond.

I must sound less than thrilled about it because she quickly says, “Sorry, I’m not trying to… I only— I saw you today, and then people said you spar at nights in the gym, and well I thought maybe I could join you because…”

“Because we’re about the same size and there aren’t that many options?” I fill in.

She nods.

“Yeah, alright,” I agree.

“Hazel,” Amelia begins softly, as we resume our positions across from one another, “if you throw this fight to get out of having to spar with someone new…”

“I wouldn’t do that,” I tell her, knowing I totally would, since I was actually considering doing precisely that.

----

I’m awake the next morning as night turns to dawn and gives way to day. I haven’t slept. I’m on approximately my thirteenth cup of coffee in half as many hours, but who’s counting? Liam never reappeared last night. If he’d given any indication he was planning on not returning, I’d be less concerned. But he didn’t, so I am. Especially considering his mood yesterday. I let my magic brush across the magic that’s binding us together, and I get no response. I heat up the ring I’m wearing for him, and once again, nothing.

Clearly he’s still alive, because I’m still alive, but he’s completely unresponsive, meaning he’s either unconscious, drugged with malusium, or both. And there’s not much I can do about it right this second.

I get dressed, braid my hair, and head to the cafeteria to get some food since I’m guessing this will probably be the one chance I have to eat today. I’m also hoping to see if I can find Henry or Amelia without having to go looking for them, which will be step two if I don’t run into them while I’m here.

I get a cup of coffee and a bowl of oatmeal and sit facing the door. My attention is split between watching the door and the spotted eagle that’s back on this side of the pass, looking for anything unusual.

The eagles are far less useful, generally speaking, than I was hoping when looking for a specific thing. If it’s not looking at the very thing you’re looking for, when you’re looking for it, good luck. It’s better than nothing, particularly for getting a bird’s eye view, but that’s not helping me right now. My best bet is going to be waiting for Iverson to show up and then having the eagle follow him, but that makes several assumptions. First, that he’s the one who took Liam. For all I know, it could be my mother, or it could be completely unrelated. It’s not likely, but it’s not entirely outside the realm of possibilities. Second, it assumes that if he took Liam, he’s going to be stupid enough or brazen enough to go back to wherever he’s keeping Liam. My money would be on the second, given what I know about General Iverson.

And while the eagles were useful as one of the few birds capable of crossing the mountains in the winter, they’re fairly notable within the confines of a large city. Something like a crow or a pigeon would probably be better solely for its ability to blend in, but I’m stuck working with what I’ve got at the moment.

Right now, the eagle is using the thermals to slowly circle above the city looking for anything obviously out of place, which I honestly don’t expect to yield any results at all. Once Iverson gets here, I’ll make sure it’s in position to follow him.

I’ve been in the cafeteria for about twenty minutes when Amelia comes in. I make sure to catch her eye so she knows I’m here, and a few minutes later she sits down.

“Have you heard anything from Liam since we talked last night?” I question without any sort of pleasantries.

“No. Why?”

“What about Peter? Have you talked to him.”

“No,” she answers again. “We were actually supposed to meet last night, but he never showed.”

“Where were you supposed to meet?”

“His place. Why?”

“His place where?” I interrogate, hoping he hasn’t been dumb enough to be bringing people back to the Ginnelstreet flats where everyone has been staying.

“Why?” She asks again.

“Does Peter normally blow you off?”

“No,” she states. “You think this is connected to Liam?”

“Yes.”

Either Peter sold Liam out, or someone has both of them. Given Liam’s mood yesterday, I’m not sure which. I honestly don’t think Peter would sell Liam out, but I do think he might sell me out and Liam might be the most expedient way for him to do that. I don’t bother to say any of that to Amelia, though.

“Do you think Peter…”

I’m not exactly sure how she was going to finish that sentence, but the answer is the same regardless. “I don’t know. Where were you supposed to meet him?”

“I’ll take you,” she tells me.

“Okay. After we hear what decision they’re rendering we’ll go. Can you go find Henry? Have him meet us here if he can do it before they start, or in the gallery if not? Tell him to blow off whatever he needs to and I’ll make sure it isn’t an issue.”

Amelia nods, already rising to leave and I go back to monitoring the eagle’s view of the city.

----

Amelia comes back with Henry shortly before eight. I’ve been sitting in the cafeteria for about an hour at this point, getting more than my fair share of appraising looks from people coming in, but I’ve been magically discouraging them all from coming over to try to talk to me as I slowly pick at my bowl of oatmeal. Throughout the time I’ve been sitting here, I’ve continued to scan the city for anything abnormal. So far there’s been nothing of note.

“Have you seen Liam anytime in the past day?” I ask Henry.

Henry nods. “I saw him yesterday, right after the assembly.”

“Did he say where he was going?”

“He said something about meeting Peter and Alex.”

Fuck. I try my ring for Alex and similarly get no response. Almost certainly my mother or Iverson then. The fact that all three of them seem to be missing pretty much rules out any other possibility being the cause. My money is on Iverson.

“I need you to go get Giorgi and Gavin,” I tell Henry. “And Davy, if you can. Meet us at Reese’s churro shop at two. Davy or Giorgi will know where it is.” I don’t know for sure that Gavin and Giorgi have ever been there, but I’m pretty sure even if they haven’t, Giorgi will still know where it is. “And it probably goes without saying, but make sure you’re not followed.”

Like yesterday, the tenor of the conversations around us begin to change and people begin filing out of the cafeteria. Apparently, they’re going to be starting soon.

“Well that’s our cue,” I remark.

Henry nods, saying, “I’ll see you later.”

Amelia and I get up to follow the crowd of people moving to the main gallery.

### 29 - Gimme Shelter

I’m not sure how it’s possible, but I think there are even more people crammed into the room today than there were yesterday. I’m in roughly the same spot near the door with Amelia beside me. You couldn’t pay me to be any further from the exit than I currently am.

The mood in the room feels tense, like there’s a storm brewing. It feels like the atmosphere in Branton has felt for weeks, if not months, only ratcheted up several notches. It definitely feels like violence is imminent. If I didn’t need to be here to hear this, I would do the smart thing and evacuate this room immediately, but I do need to hear whatever their decision is, because it’s going to directly impact whatever I do next.

The crowd is so thick I can barely see through it, but I do glimpse my mother, Commander Selby, and General Iverson at the front of the room. I assume the other Commanders are up there somewhere too.

Commander Selby holds up a hand and waits for the roar of conversation throughout the room to come to a halt. It takes a couple of minutes, but eventually people notice and shush or elbow those nearby into silence.

“After lengthy discussion among ourselves over the past day, we have unanimously agreed there is not enough evidence to either substantiate or repudiate Alexandria Raidane’s accusations toward General Iverson and Dairuvar,” he says in a rumble which carries throughout the room.

The volume of the crowd immediately begins increasing at this statement.

“However,” Commander Selby shouts, and waits for the room to quiet again. “However, we do agree that a recall vote regarding General Iverson’s ability to serve as the Army of the Allied Polities’ commander is warranted.”

I’m not surprised. This is exactly what my mother wanted, and I gave her the perfect way to go about obtaining it. I’m fairly certain this is going to end with a no confidence vote in General Iverson’s ability to act in the best interest of the Allied Polities, rather than the best interests of Dairuvar. In which case, interim command of the Allied Army will fall to Commander Selby until new candidates are selected and voting concludes.

I only know this because I consulted several of the books on Liam’s bookshelf last night in search of the answer to the question, since I couldn’t sleep.

Practically, this will likely be the equivalent to unmuzzling and unleashing General Iverson. While I agree he needs to be removed from his position, doing it like this is idiocy equivalent to giving him the position in the first place. The only way to adequately remove him from the position now isn’t via a vote, but via a targeted political assassination. If Commander Selby was smart, he wouldn’t be calling a vote this morning, he’d be raising a flag to half staff and announcing an untimely and unexpected demise. Sure, there’d be rumors and allegations surrounding the timing of his death, but right now, whether he realizes it or not, Commander Selby is about to rip the alliance apart and trigger a civil war.

Action, meet consequence.

My mother looks immensely pleased. General Iverson looks like he’s contemplating tearing the war college apart, brick by brick. And since I’m pretty sure I could do it, I’m pretty sure he could too. If he has Liam and the others, this does not bode well for them, or for me. It *almost* makes me hope my mother has them, but I’m pretty sure she doesn’t.

“In the interest of transparency,” Commander Selby continues, “voting will take place now. Commander Melbrin, in the matter of removing General Iverson from his position, do you vote to remove him?”

“Yes.”

“Avonare votes to remove General Iverson,” Commander Selby calls out.

The aide makes a note.

“Commander Varit, how do you vote?”

“I vote against removing General Iverson,” Commander Varit states, surprising no one. The last thing Dairuvar wants is to see Iverson ousted from his current position.

“Commander Graham, how do you vote?”

“I’m in favor of removing General Iverson’s position as Commander of the Army of the Allied Polities.”

The aide continues to note down the votes.

“Commander Errigan, how do you vote?”

“Oulanen is against removing General Iverson,” Commander Errigan tells the assembly.

“Commander Soto, how do you vote?”

“Leira abstains,” Commander Soto states, also surprising no one.

“The votes are two in favor of removing General Iverson, two against removing General Iverson, and one abstention.” Commander Selby announces, casting a clearly annoyed look at Commander Soto. “Meaning as Commander of the War College of the Army of the Allied Polities, I cast the deciding vote. I also see the conflict that allowing General Iverson to maintain his position as the Commander of the Army of the Allied Polities presents. I vote with Avonare and Firgasu. General Iverson shall be removed from his position, and we will begin the search for a new Commander.”

All hell breaks loose. I grab Amelia’s arm and shove our way through the door into the hallway, beating the sea of people who will soon spill into it, and pull her toward Commander Selby’s office. I let us in as soon as we get there. Since everyone else is still in the press of people in the main gallery, there’s no one to see me do so, or raise any objections.

“What are we doing here?” Amelia whispers once I’ve shut the office door.

“Waiting for Commander Selby, obviously. You don’t have to whisper.”

“*Why* are we waiting for Commander Selby?”

“To make sure he doesn’t know where Liam is, and to make sure there are no unanswered questions about our absence,” I state as I survey the room.

I’ve never been in his office before. It’s less military themed than I would have expected, making me realize I don’t really know anything at all about Commander Selby. I’ve never had any reason to speak to him, and avoided him beyond that, for obvious reasons.

We’ve been in the office for a bit more than ten minutes when Commander Selby finally opens the door, striding into the room and locking it behind him, clearly desperate to get away from the press of people. It’s another couple of seconds before he realizes we’re here.

His eyes land on me, and the slight widening says he clearly knows who I am.

He pinches the bridge of his nose before saying, “Miss Raidane. Miss Price. To what do I owe the honor?”

I’m both surprised and pleased he doesn’t feign outrage, or question how we got into his office. “Do you know where Captain Marten is?”

“Liam?” Commander Selby asks, indicating a fair level of familiarity. “No. Why?”

“No one has seen him since yesterday.”

“And you think that’s a problem?”

“Yes.”

“And what would you like me to do about that?”

“Nothing. I’d simply like to ensure the absences of ourselves and Henry Sheppard are not remarked upon until such a time as we return with Captain Marten.”

“What happened to Lisette Clark, Miss Raidane?”

“She died.”

“How?”

“Unpleasantly.”

Commander Selby sighs. “I have more important things to care about than your whereabouts.”

That’s good enough for me, but since I’m already here, I decide to press my luck. “You cast the deciding vote,” I say.

“Was there a question in there somewhere?” he asks irritably.

“It seems like you probably understand what will happen next.”

“Better than you do, certainly.”

“Then why?”

“He needed to be removed.”

“You would have been better off removing him permanently,” I comment, and I hear a sharp intake of breath from Amelia.

“We can’t go around killing polity leaders, Miss Raidane.”

“It’d be a lot simpler if you could,” I state as I stand.

Amelia exits ahead of me, seemingly eager to be out of the room. As I pull the door shut behind me I think I hear him mutter, “I see why he likes you.”

## Part 3

### 30 - Smooth Criminal

Amelia leads us southwest, away from the war college, toward wherever it is Peter normally lives when he’s not trying to be hard to find.

The southwestern quadrant of Branton is by far the quietest area of the city. It’s almost all small neighborhoods interspersed with tiny green spaces, where old couples and people with young families reside. It’s not where I expected Peter to live. But if I strip out everything that’s happened over the past several months, and think back to the Peter who I met that first day in the pub with Davy, this is *exactly* where I would have expected *that* Peter to live. Who knows, maybe the Peter I met that first day is closer to the real Peter than any other version.

People are complicated. Mostly that’s neither a good nor bad thing. But when people are complicated the way Peter is, or even the way that Alex is, and definitely the way that I am, it’s just hard. Maybe those similarities between Peter and me are what Alex, Davy, and Liam have been trying to make me understand for a while now.

It’s roughly a thirty minute walk to reach Peter’s flat, deep within one of the southwestern quadrant’s many neighborhoods. His door is a cheery turquoise which looks like it’s been fairly recently painted.

“Do you know how long he’s lived here?” I ask Amelia as I look around the street.

“A while, I think. At least a few years.”

“Do you have a key?”

“No. We don’t exactly have the ‘exchange keys’ kind of relationship.”

“Okay. So when you got here last night you knocked and no one answered? You didn’t go in?” I check.

“No, I didn’t go in. I waited around for a while getting progressively more annoyed, and then left,” she tells me, sounding frustrated.

I block the door with my body for a moment, pantomiming having a key while I use magic to unlock the door and check if anyone is inside, but the flat is empty. I open the door and allow Amelia to enter first, and then lock it behind me as I follow her in.

“Anything seem out of the ordinary?” I question.

“No,” she says softly, after glancing over the space briefly.

I begin looking around. It’s very tidy and very homey. It gives off the vibe of the kind of person who would enjoy hosting dinner parties.

“Bedroom?” I ask.

“Back through the hall. Last door.”

I find the bedroom door cracked, and push it all the way open. The bed is made, and the curtains are open. I begin opening drawers. It doesn’t look like any clothes are missing. At least, not as far as I can tell.

“Do you know how often Peter’s here?” I call out to Amelia.

“At least every couple of days,” she calls back.

I continue opening drawers until I come across a small notebook. I flip it open and it’s writing, writing, more writing. It looks like a journal. I flip to the end. The most recent entry is from three days ago. Nothing especially noteworthy. No roadmap written out detailing a plan to sell me out to Iverson, not that I’d expect Peter to be so dumb if he were planning something like that, but it doesn’t hurt to check. I shove the notebook into my bag for later.

I head to the bathroom. All the toiletries are present. It looks like whatever happened, Peter expected to come back.

“I don’t think there’s anything to find here,” I tell Amelia. “Let’s go.”

----

“What do you think happened?” Amelia wonders, as we walk toward Reese’s shop.

“I think someone took them.”

“Iverson?”

“Or my mother,” I respond. “But probably Iverson. Is Michael still hanging around with my mother and Christine?”

“I don’t know. I haven’t talked to him in a while, but I assume so. He’s got nowhere else to go here.”

“We should go talk to him later,” I say, more to myself than to her. I really don’t think my mother took them. If she had them, she’d want to make sure I knew she had them. She’d have left some sort of message or messenger, the same way she did after the pass, but it doesn’t hurt to check.

It takes about twenty-five minutes to make it from Peter’s neighborhood to Reese’s shop. I lead us to the same spot Peter and I scoped out the shop last time. I can already tell the shop doesn’t look open which, in the middle of the day, is a bad sign for any business, but especially a twenty-four hour one. I want to go in and see what I can find, but I decide to be smart and watch the place for a while first. It should allow enough time for Henry, Giorgi, and Gavin to show up. Hopefully with Davy. If Iverson has Davy too, it makes the situation that much worse.

Amelia and I are early, so we’ve got about an hour before the others are supposed to meet us here. We sit in silence, since neither of us is all that keen on conversation, at the moment. During that time, I don’t see any movement in the shop. No one goes in, and no one comes out. I can’t feel anything alive in there either, and stretching my senses out, I can’t feel any other magic users in the area. If there are any around, they have their energy meridians dimmed, and I probably wouldn’t be able to tell they’re here unless I know who they are, and visually see them.

The shop gives me a bad feeling, though.

After a while, I pull out Peter’s journal and begin to flip through it while we wait for the others to show up.

“What’s that?” Amelia inquires eventually.

“Nothing,” I answer.

“You seem pretty interested in it for ‘nothing.’”

I shrug, but don’t reply, and she goes back to watching the shop.

“Well, shit,” I mutter as I flip through a few pages.

“*What?*” Amelia questions, clearly exasperated.

“Nothing,” I repeat.

Amelia snatches the notebook from my hands. I sigh, but make no move to grab it back. Doing so would just turn into a grappling match and undoubtedly draw a bunch of attention we don’t need.

“Well, shit,” she echoes, as she reads the pages I just finished.

Once she looks up, meeting my eyes, I snatch the journal back.

“Hey!”

“You probably shouldn’t snoop,” I tell her. “Even if you’re *not* in a relationship with Peter.”

“It seems like *you’re* the one who shouldn’t be snooping,” Amelia retorts.

“Yeah. Well.” It’s a valid statement to which I have no good response, especially since I intend to continue snooping.

“Did you know Liam told Peter that?”

“No,” I answer truthfully.

“You know they’ve been friends pretty much their entire lives, right?”

“Yes.”

“That’s pretty brutal.”

I nod. No wonder Liam didn’t want to relay the content of their conversation to me. Fuck. Now I feel bad for Peter. I don’t want to feel bad for *Peter*.

“What’s brutal?” Gavin wants to know.

I startle at the sound, having been so distracted by the journal and the conversation with Amelia that I didn’t realize they were approaching.

“Nothing,” I respond quickly.

At the same time Amelia blurts out, “Liam told Peter that if Peter and Hazel couldn’t work their shit out, he’d choose Hazel. Regardless of what happened or how it went down, even if Hazel was the one forcing him to choose, he’d choose Hazel, so Peter had better figure out how to fix things in order to stop it from getting to that point.”

“Oh. Obviously,” Gavin states.

“Obviously?” Amelia and I ask at the same time. I’m not sure what her rationale is, but I’m not sure *I* would choose me. Especially not if I was the one forcing the choice.

“Obviously,” Gavin repeats, but doesn’t elaborate.

“Whatever,” I reply. “It doesn’t matter right now. Davy! When did you last see Alex?”

“Yesterday, around noon, when he left with Peter and Liam. No response since then.”

“Do you know what they were doing? Liam seemed pissed.”

“Coming here. Reese was missing,” he informs me, clearly worried, not that you’d be able to tell from his words alone.

“Fuck,” I hiss. “Okay. Giorgi and I will go look around the shop. The rest of you stay here. Davy, be careful, yeah?”

“You too,” Davy tells me.

Giorgi and I enter through the front door, which is unlocked despite the shop being unoccupied. The shop isn’t quite trashed, but it’s not far from it. There’s a haze of soot high on the walls and ceiling that I don’t remember seeing before. Someone clearly either didn’t care if anyone knew they were here, or wanted to *make sure* anyone who came looking *knew* they were here. My money is on the latter.

“Do you know where Reese lives?” I question Giorgi as I poke around.

He nods.

“I figured.”

Giorgi shrugs. “Someone’s got to keep track of these things.”

“Someone does,” I agree. “What do you think?”

“Someone wanted to make sure it was obvious something happened here.”

“Yeah. If Peter, Liam, and Alex weren’t all missing, I’d be questioning whether Reese could have done this,” I comment.

“Why?” Giorgi asks.

“If you’d seen her last time we were here…” I say with a shrug. “She might have decided running was a good option. But since the others are all missing too, it looks like someone decided for her.”

“Or wanted to make it look like they decided for her. She still could have run, and someone else could have decided to make it look like they took her,” Giorgi remarks, thinking aloud.

“Yeah, maybe. I’m not sure it makes any difference.”

He nods.

“Okay. Let’s go.”

I lock the door behind us, for all the good it will do, and we head back to the others. I give them the short version of what we saw in there.

“I think Giorgi, Davy, and I should go check out Reese’s. Amelia, Gavin and Henry, you guys can go talk to Michael, make sure Reese isn’t there and my mother isn’t—”

I stop talking.

“What?” Davy asks sharply.

“How many people do you think live in the buildings around the Ginnelstreet flats?”

“I don’t know. A couple of hundred maybe. Why?”

“In the building itself?”

“No one, as far as I can tell. All the other floors are empty. Hazel, *why*?”

“Alex would have had a key with him, right?”

Davy nods, and I’m already running.

### 31 - Burning Down the House

I’m too far away. I’ll never make it to the flat in time. I stop running and focus all of my attention on the eagle above the city as the others catch up. It’s only a couple of minutes before I see the building. Shit. They’re already there. It was all a diversion. I *should* have seen it.

“Davy, I need rain! As much rain as fast as you can, everywhere! Have Giorgi help if you need it!”

The situation is far from ideal. I’m a couple of miles away from the flat, and fire can be difficult to control under the best of circumstances—circumstances which would at least place me within a couple of blocks of the building where I would be able to control this better, where I would be able to contain the spread of what I’m about to do. But it doesn’t matter because there’s not a better option I can see.

Someone’s people are in the building, and it doesn’t matter if it’s my mother’s people or Iverson’s. If they have Alex, they have a key. And if getting the key was worth grabbing Alex, Peter, and Liam, whatever’s in there that they want, I’ve already decided they can’t have it. They simply can’t.

While it doesn’t take *that* much energy to set a dry piece of wood alight, it *does* take a fair amount of energy to set every inch of a building ablaze at exactly the same moment in a conflagration so hot it almost instantly turns the wood to ash. On top of that, I need *rain*, not snow, meaning I can’t take the energy from the heat in our current surroundings because Davy’s going to need it.

Two out of the three deer managed to survive the winter, so I pull on the connections I have with them hard. A lot harder than is ideal, but letting whoever is in the flat have whatever they’re looking for would be a lot worse. I can’t explain why I’m so sure, I just am, so consequences be damned. I do it anyway.

As soon as I start pulling power from the deer, I’m directing it, as best I can from this distance, at the Ginnelstreet flat, using what I can see via the eyes of a fucking bird to do it. This is so far from ideal. It’s like trying to perform surgery with a broadsword.

Flames immediately engulf the interior of the building, which is almost all wood, but I continue feeding power into the fire because the exterior of the structure is brick, and it hasn’t completely disintegrated into a pile of ash or collapsed in a heap of burned rubble, which is the result I’m looking for. Since I have no idea what they’re trying to find, nothing can remain. Not the building, not any of the people in it—who according to Davy, *should* all be working for whoever took Liam and Alex—not the furniture. Everything needs to go.

I’m fighting with the fire to keep it burning hot enough while also stopping it from spreading to easier, more flammable structures nearby as the fire consumes more and more of the building. It feels like the amount of heat radiating off of my body isn’t tremendously different from what’s coming off of the fire itself, but it doesn’t matter. If I don’t maintain control of the fire, that whole twisted section of the city will go up in flames—it’s a lot of old wooden structures built a handful of feet away from each other.

The building is still burning. I’m not exactly sure how long it’s been, but I feel like it has to have been more than twenty minutes at this point. I haven’t seen anyone make it out of the building alive. Most of it has been reduced to ash, but there are recognizable sections of the building which need to keep burning. I want ash with a consistency like dry snow. By the time the fire is out, I want the only evidence that a building ever existed there to be the gap where it once stood and a twisted heap of burned brick rubble. So I continue to pour energy into it.

Finally, I feel raindrops hit my skin.

“She’s sizzling,” I hear someone say, but it doesn’t matter.

The frequency with which the raindrops are hitting my skin increases, and as it does, I throw the floodgates open. Within minutes the building is completely gone, and now I’m fighting to stop the fire from spreading to the surrounding buildings. Putting out a fire this size is no small feat.

I’ve cut off all the energy I was feeding into it, and I’m trying to pull back everything remaining, but I’m so far away it’s proving next to impossible over this kind of distance after that kind of effort.

Luckily, the rain has increased from a drizzle to a downpour to a deluge. It’s falling so heavily now, it’s actually becoming difficult to breathe, which is fine, because this is exactly the amount of water I needed. From a bird’s eye view, I no longer see any visible flames, only steam. Hopefully, the rainfall will be sustained enough to keep anything from reigniting.

I take an uneven breath, and stumble as I reach out for the side of the nearest building to brace myself.

“We need to move,” I gasp raggedly. “I don’t care where for now. Anywhere not here.”

“Okay,” Davy agrees, taking the lead.

I stumble after him, trying not to trip over my own feet.

Davy looks back at me and orders, “Gavin, Henry, help her. I have the feeling we want to be gone sooner rather than later.”

----

We come to a stop in front of a heavily disused warehouse several miles south of the docks where the fights frequently take place. It took a couple of hours of wending our way through Branton’s twistier streets to get here, with Gavin bracing me on one side and Henry on the other. I’d have long since fallen behind or forced the others to slow down if they weren’t halfway dragging me along. Firestorms are beastly things. Especially when you’re trying to wield them with precision. I need some food and a few hours of sleep. I’m not sure if I’ll get either.

The sky is still darkened by storm clouds making the late afternoon look more like late evening, but I’m grateful for the thick cloud cover and rain keeping people off the streets. The fewer prying eyes to see our passage, the better.

“In here,” Davy directs, as he slides a door open.

The entire floor of the warehouse is covered in a thick layer of dust. Going based off of that, no one has been here in months, maybe even years. We come in streaming water, turning the floor we’re standing on into a muddy tableau.

Davy heaves the door shut, metal groaning in protest as he does, finally dropping a pin into the hasp to secure it behind us. “We should be fine in here for a while if everyone who knows how to dim their energy meridians does so.”

“What did you do?” Amelia asks, looking at me.

“I, uh, hope you guys didn’t have anything valuable in the flats,” I begin by way of explanation, as I look from Gavin to Giorgi.

“Only all of our current worldly possessions,” Gavin answers.

“Sorry,” I wince slightly as I say it. “The building no longer exactly… exists.”

“Define ‘no longer exactly exists,’” Gavin demands.

“Went up in flames?” I try.

“I think knowing you might be hazardous to our health,” Gavin comments, but he doesn’t sound particularly upset as he surveys the interior of the warehouse.

“Yeah. Well, I did try to warn you all about that,” I remind him with a sigh. A small part of me can’t believe I burned the entire building to the ground. “So, how mad do you think Liam is going to be?”

“Honestly,” Gavin replies, “I don’t think he’ll give a shit. It was just a building.”

“I hope you’re right.”

“He is,” Giorgi agrees. “Liam won’t care.”

I nod. I’m exhausted, and we still need to *find* them. All that, and I have no idea where they are. I crouch down, leaning my back against one of the warehouse’s structural support pillars and close my eyes, resisting the urge to scream in frustration.

“Draw them out?” I ask after a moment, talking to Davy.

“I think we’ll have to,” Davy answers, knowing the question was meant for him.

“I’ll be the bait.”

“You always are.”

I always am.

“We should all sleep,” I tell everyone. “Sleep now, tactics when we wake up. The earliest we’ll move will be tomorrow night. We’ll probably need to do something about food, if anyone wants to handle that.” I throw out, deciding food falls under supply chain and logistics, which are not among my specialties.

“I’ll do it,” Giorgi states.

“Thanks,” Davy and I say together.

----

I wake up sometime later, slightly disoriented with the feeling that I’m forgetting something important. It must be the remnants of a dream because, at the moment, there’s nothing I could have forgotten.

Amelia, Henry, and Gavin are engaged in a quiet conversation about a dozen feet away. Davy is napping a few feet away from me on my other side with an arm thrown over his face. And Giorgi is sitting alone, just… staring at me?

“What?” I inquire.

“Food?” he queries in response.

“Alright,” I answer, and he passes me some bread. “Why were you watching me sleep?”

“No reason,” he remarks in a way that clearly indicates there was a reason.

“Whatever,” I grumble. “What time is it?”

“A bit before midnight, I think.”

“Damn. Davy, wake up,” I order as I stretch a leg across to jostle him. I’m guessing he didn’t sleep last night either. “Did the rest of you sleep?”

Giorgi nods and says, “A couple of hours.”

Davy sits up, rubbing the sleep from his eyes.

“Good?” I question.

“Yeah. What do you think about the Northend Bluffs?” Davy wonders.

“You’re thinking about the cliffs?”

Davy nods.

If he’s thinking what I think he’s thinking, it’s not a bad idea. The cliffs are about fifty feet above the river there, and the river is deep enough to jump from the cliffs without having to worry about avoiding rocks or breaking bones. I know because we’ve done it. We’ve even done it in the dark. This time of year, the water will be cold but not freezing, and the river has a decent current there, without being so fast that it’s dangerous. In theory, it makes for a good egress point.

“Can Peter swim?” I ask Giorgi.

He nods.

“We don’t know what condition anyone will be in,” Gavin reminds us from the far side of the room, having apparently been listening in on our conversation.

“We’ll stipulate condition,” I tell him, sounding more confident than I’m sure I have any right to. “Iverson wants me. I’m the bait. We’ll stipulate the condition the others have to be in for me to show up.”

“What are you guys thinking?” Gavin questions curiously.

“I can find us a couple of small boats,” Davy says, thinking aloud. “The hard part is going to be getting everyone over the cliff and into the boats before he can do anything about it.”

Yeah. That’s definitely the hard part.

“I’ll come up with something,” I state, though I have no idea what. Maybe just a good old fashioned ‘Run!’ since beggars can’t be choosers and all that. “What time are you thinking? I need to send out invitations,” and do a few other things.

“Midnight? May as well play into the drama of it all,” Davy answers.

I nod. “Okay. Midnight. You’ll be waiting with boats near the base of the cliff?”

“Yes.”

“Okay, I’ll see you guys tomorrow,” I tell them as I stand and head toward the door.

“Where are you going?” Amelia asks.

“I have invitations to deliver.”

### 32 - Repeat

I slide the metal door of the warehouse shut behind me and lean back against it. I am so screwed. I’m trying to organize my thoughts into a list of things I need to do in the next twenty, or so, hours but it feels overwhelming, endless, and next to impossible. I can think and move at the same time though, so I start heading back toward the city at a fast walk, which quickly increases to a jog.

Once I’ve covered about three miles, I slow back to a walk. The streets are mostly empty. I’m a few miles south of the city, and there isn’t much reason for people to be out late in this area. I begin scanning the buildings. I’m looking for one that looks like it has easy rooftop access with a mostly flat roof.

It takes a few minutes because the buildings are a lot less dense here, but I finally find one with a drainpipe running along the exterior of the building which looks secure enough to hold my weight as I climb up it. When I reach the roof, I move to the center and wait. After a minute, I hear a scuff behind me.

“Do you have any more bread?” I inquire.

“Yes. How long have you known I was following you?” Giorgi asks.

“Pretty much since I left. Your idea, or Davy’s?”

“We both thought it was a good idea for everyone to have backup.”

“And you were the obvious choice.”

“Yes,” he agrees, walking toward me to hand me what I assume is the remaining bread.

I sigh, but don’t say anything else as I take the bread and begin crumbling it in my hand, letting my senses expand outward. A single spotted eagle isn’t going to cut it. It’s too big, too obvious, and too singular. There’s a flock of pigeons roosting not far from here. I urge the wind to pick up enough to stir the branches of the tree they’re perching on, causing a few of them to take flight or risk falling, and then call them to me.

Before long, I have one pigeon perched immobile on my hand, and another on the ground in front of me. I begin making them into new extensions of myself. Me, but not me. The one on my hand is first by virtue of being closest, and as the magic snaps into place, my stomach drops a little bit. At this point, I’m no longer sure it’s even distaste for what I’m doing. I think it might be some sort of sensory thing. Like seasickness. At least, that’s what I tell myself as I start on the second one.

My stomach flips a little bit more when the magic for the second settles into place, and I send both of them back to roost for the night. Once again, I let my senses expand back outward, looking, looking, looking.

I feel an owl swooping over a nearby field after a few minutes, and urge it to me as well and begin the process again, sending it away when I’ve finished, breathing deeply to quell the nausea that’s building.

*Two more. I need two more.*

I know next to nothing about owls, but finding them takes long enough that I figure they must have decent range sizes. Finally I locate a second, and by the time I’ve finished, I’ve taken a knee and am bracing myself with a hand flat against the rooftop. It doesn’t matter that the world is slowly spinning around me. I need another. I let my senses expand outward while I keep my vision narrowly focused on my hand in front of me in an effort to still the world.

*One more.*

Eventually, another owl lands on the rooftop in front of me. I take a deep breath and resist the urge to preemptively apologize to it as I start working. Me, but not me. Very, very much not me, since I don’t expect them all to live through the night. But it doesn’t matter. Not really. I want it, and I let myself have it.

The dizziness slams into me with a new intensity and I’m heaving up a mixture of bread and bile.

“Fuck,” I mutter, wiping my mouth with the back of my hand. “I thought I was past that.”

“Here,” Giorgi says, holding out a waterskin.

“Thanks,” I reply softly as I take it and rinse my mouth.

“Is that how we got through the pass?”

“Not exactly,” I answer truthfully and without elaborating. “I’m going to have you take one of these. It’ll be good for Davy to have eyes on the top of the cliff.”

“How?”

“Imagine I’m holding the magic in my hand,” I explain, still kneeling. “And imagine your magic is like a third hand, and you can reach out and take it. Then keep trying until you do.”

It takes about twenty minutes of trial and error, but eventually he figures it out. I was pretty confident he’d be able to.

“Now that you have it, let yourself look through its eyes. You’ll be able to nudge where it goes and what it does, but ultimately, it’s still simply an owl. A light touch is best.”

“Huh,” is the entirety of Giorgi’s reaction.

“Ready?”

He nods.

“Know any good night markets?” I ask once we’re back on the ground.

“On a Tuesday? No. Why?”

“I need a pen and paper.”

“You have Peter’s journal, right? Just rip a page out of that,” Giorgi comments with a shrug.

I was going to give it back, but I can do that less a few pages, right?

“Do you have anything to write with?” I inquire.

“No, but there’s bound to be something in one of these buildings.”

It’s true, but I sigh loudly anyway as I let us into the closest building. I hate looking. Looking takes forever.

The first building is so jam-packed with stuff it’s difficult to move in. There’s probably something to write with in here somewhere, but good luck finding it. We decide to abandon it after a handful of minutes, and move on to the next. The next looks much more like I would expect the inside of a warehouse to look. It seems like it’s some sort of metal shop, but there are a couple of small offices in the back which have both pencils and paper, so I don’t have to rip pages out of Peter’s journal.

I scrawl five notes to be safe, though I’m not sure I’ll need all of them. They all say the same thing: *Northend Bluffs. Midnight. Alex, Peter, Liam unhurt and walking on their own. Trade.*

I don’t bother to specify what we’re trading. Me for them, whatever was in the flat for them, three dozen eggs for them. Iverson can assign whatever meaning he wants to it, since I don’t have any intention of trading anything for them. He can’t take what’s mine and I won’t trade to get them back.

Back outside, I find five rocks about half the size of my fist and begin ripping lengths of fabric from my shirt, wrapping each note around a rock and using the fabric to tie it in place. Then I call both of the owls that are still bound to me, sending each on its way carrying a rock with a note tied to it. Two of five. We’ll see if I need the other three.

Giorgi and I continue walking toward Branton in silence.

It’s probably a little after three in the morning when the first owl reaches its destination, dropping the rock in the entry of Reese’s shop, and turning to fly back toward Giorgi and me. The next lands at the last spot I saw Iverson before diverting the eagle to the Ginnelstreet flats. I direct it to land on a wide windowsill and it moves the rock from its talons to its beak, then starts banging the rock against the window.

On the seventh rap against the glass, the glass shatters. The owl drops the rock and takes flight. I begin counting its wingbeats as it flies away.

*One. Two. Three. Fou—* It’s like I took a hook to the side of my temple. I thought I was prepared, but the fact that I’m lying flat out on the ground says otherwise. I hold my head, waiting for my vision to clear, as Giorgi grabs me under the arms and begins pulling me upright.

“What the hell just happened?” he demands, and it might be the first time I’ve ever heard him sound anything other than neutral, indifferent, or amused.

“Iverson,” I groan, my hands still wrapped around my head as I try to force my brain to remember it exists within the confines of my skull. “Killed. The messenger.” I manage to get out between ragged gasps of pain.

“Well, I guess you can consider the invitations delivered. Can you stand?” Giorgi asks.

“Give me a minute,” I state, as I move a hand to one of his arms to brace myself. “Damn. That hurt.”

----

I’ve moved both of the pigeons to locations around the Dairuvar compound, where they’re currently blending in, being pigeons, waiting for Iverson to move. For all I know, he could have something similar in place, but I don’t think he does. Or at least, I don’t think he does *right now*. Mostly, because I don’t think he knows where I am. But once I get to the Northend Bluffs he’ll know exactly where to look, which raises its own set of problems that I ponder as we make our way north.

At least I know he’s still there, based on the reception the owl delivering my message received.

“We need to stop and get food,” I say. “Some sandwiches or something we can eat on the move.”

“Hand pies?” Giorgi asks with a gleam in his brown eyes.

“I hate hand pies.”

Giorgi grins.

We find a vendor who’s just opening for the day. Fortunately, he’s not selling hand pies but frittatas. We order a couple each and are back on the move again as soon as we receive them.

“So what’s the plan?” Giorgi finally questions.

“Don’t die. Don’t lose.”

“Seriously.”

“Seriously. I don’t have any plans.” I tell him, which isn’t *exactly* true. But it's mostly true. “I have ideas about some ways to possibly avoid dying.”

I run through possible scenarios in my head, over and over, but all I see are flaws in all of them. I consider aiming for ‘trust me, I’m harmless,’ but after the past twenty four hours, I think we’re well beyond that. He knows I’m not harmless, so I may as well aim for every possible advantage. Only any advantage I have time to preemptively give myself, he has time to counteract. That’s the problem with magic: whatever you can do, there’s probably someone else who can do it too. That’s why no sensible person wages wars using magic. All you’re going to get with that is complete and utter destruction.

I’m going around in circles and getting nowhere. I need a change of perspective. I need to think about something else.

“Tell me something I don’t know,” I say to Giorgi, apropos of nothing.

Giorgi’s eyes dart to me and then quickly dance away. I see his jaw flex.

“Oh,” I comment. “You think you know something *big* that I don’t know! What is it?”

“I didn’t say that,” he responds, and I sense feigned disinterest in his tone.

“I’m pretty sure you did. At least your face did,” I inform him. “Which is actually interesting, because it means it’s definitely something big. Or at least you think it is.”

“How do you figure?”

“The question surprised you enough that whatever your first response to it was, it garnered a reaction of its own, so it must be something big.”

Giorgi shrugs, but says nothing as the breeze ruffles through his hair.

I start guessing, watching his expression as I do.

“Something about Liam?” I ask, pausing long enough to see if I get a reaction. “No. Not Liam. Something about Peter?” Still nothing. “Probably not Alex. Have you figured out something about my mother?” I wait half a second, but there’s no reaction. “How would you have, though? Same with Iverson. So not either of them. Amelia?” Still nothing. “No. Henry? Nope. Gavin? Gavin’s practically an open book. If it was about you, you wouldn’t have reacted. Hell, you wouldn’t have even thought it,” I mutter.

“Davy? No, that doesn’t make any sense either. Davy’s a steel trap. Process of elimination says that only leaves me,” I state, remembering the way he was staring at me when I woke up earlier.

I think he momentarily misses a breath.

“Something about me, then. Something big. What is it you think you know about me, Giorgi?”

“Nothing.”

“Definitely not nothing. Definitely something. And you think it’s something I don’t know. What?”

“Ask Davy. See what he says,” Giorgi tells me with a finality that lets me know I’m not going to get anything more out of him.

### 33 - Run!

I’ve been waiting at the Northend Bluffs for hours. Giorgi and I separated shortly before I got here. He tried to argue, tried to convince me he should stay with me at least for a while, but the fact of the matter is that he needs to meet up with Davy, and I don’t need Iverson following him to Davy when he does.  What’s more, I don’t need anyone else on top of the cliff to worry about when Iverson gets here. Liam, Alex, and Peter are going to be more than enough. Giorgi’s capable, but he’s not *that* capable. I’m not sure anyone is that capable. Including me.

It’s probably close to seven in the evening, and since I’ve arrived, I’ve done practically nothing. I’m operating under the assumption that I’m being watched, so at least that’s how I’m hoping it looks from the outside. When I first got here, I took a quick look around, and counted my steps to the edge of the cliff. Since that point, I’ve been sitting on the ground, about thirty-five feet away from the cliff’s edge, waiting.

I briefly considered having a thick fog roll in before I got here, to make things difficult for anyone watching, but ultimately decided it wasn’t worth the effort. Iverson could likely dissipate it if he wanted to, and wasting energy battling over the weather would be useless. Instead, I’ve been very subtly cultivating the conditions for fog immediately over the river at the base of the cliff, in a way that will hopefully look completely natural and be entirely undetectable once night sets in. It should be precisely enough to obscure Davy and the others, and nothing more, since I don’t want to give Iverson any reason to think twice about the river.

I know there’s a good chance Iverson will either show up earlier or later than the appointed time, and even though we didn’t discuss it, Davy will know it too. I expect he’ll be ready and waiting regardless.

So. I’ve been sitting here, communing with nature, building a mental map of the bluff, just in case. You never know what might be useful. The hours tick by with agonizing slowness, but I give no outward sign of my agitation.

I *can* be calm and hold still when I have to, even if I prefer not to.

Finally, as night falls, I see Iverson leaving the Dairuvar compound. He’s on horseback, along with three men I don’t recognize. Alex, Liam, and Peter are being loaded into an open wagon, but they’re all conscious, which is good news. I estimate that they’ll probably arrive sometime around eleven.

I don’t move or give any outward sign I know they’re coming, even though my heart rate has definitely picked up its cadence. I breathe in, and I breathe out as I watch them progress northward through the city.

*Soon, soon, soon, soon,* my inner voice repetitively chants needing something to do as they draw closer and closer.

The breeze tickles my skin, and the leaves on the trees rustle softly. I hear an owl hoot somewhere nearby, and briefly wonder if it’s the one I gave to Giorgi keeping watch, not that it matters—but my brain won’t shut up. The waiting is always the worst part. I would prefer to be actively doing something, even if it’s something terrible. But right now, I force myself to wait.

They’re less than a mile away, but I remain seated on the ground, unmoving, until I can see them with my own eyes. When I finally do, I stand. Iverson stops their group about twenty feet away from me.

I can see Liam, Alex, and Peter in the wagon. Peter’s head is bowed, so all I see is his close cropped dark hair, but it looks like he’s looking down at his hands. Liam’s eyes are surveying our immediate vicinity, maybe looking for the others. Alex is looking at me intently, and he’s the one I’m focused on. I’m throwing all my feelings directly at him—screaming ‘Jump!’—hoping he picks up on them, which it seems like he’s trying to do.

I stand waiting silently until Iverson dismounts. He’s dressed entirely in unadorned black, as are the other three men on horseback and the one driving the wagon. I’m reminded of the first night I saw him, nearly a year ago now, on the western bridge. The others in his party stay atop their horses.

We stare across the distance at one another for a few moments. The moon is at my back and ever so slightly lights his face, his eyes are lost in the shadows cast by his brow, but I do note a slight stubble covering his cheeks where I’ve always seen him clean-shaven before.

“Hi, dad,” I greet.

It’s difficult to tell in this light, but I think he flinches slightly, and I grin in response. Score one point for me.

“So, are you going to let them go, or what?” I ask.

“You said you would trade,” he responds in a low voice which still manages to carry to me.

I nod. “I did. We will. Let them out, and I’ll give you what you want.”

“Give me what I want, and I’ll let them out,” he counters with the obvious response.

I shake my head. “Sorry. I can’t do that. Not until you let them out. See, right now things are skewed a little too far in your favor. There are four of you and only one of me. I’d prefer if our sides were a little more balanced before giving you what you want. Especially since I’m pretty sure you’re quite a bit more powerful than me.” I tack the last bit on just for good measure. You never know what casually stroking someone’s ego can do for you.

He makes no move to release them, and gives no order for his men to do so. He merely stands there silently evaluating me.

I sigh, and then sit back down on the ground, as if I am completely unbothered and have nothing better to be doing and nowhere better to be doing it. I am, at this point, fully embodying the ‘I can’t’ aspect of my statement.

At least two minutes tick by, but I do and say nothing. Eventually, he turns to one of his men and nods. The man walks back to the wagon, and lowers the rear gate before climbing in and untying them. They all step out, and begin walking toward me.

“The trade,” Iverson states impatiently.

“Yes, of course,” I answer as I stand. “One second.”

They’re all moving a little bit slower than I would hope, indicating they were probably recently drugged and the effects are still wearing off, but they all look well enough for what’s required for the remainder of my plan.

Liam reaches me first, the moonlight glinting off of his hair, followed ever so slightly by Peter and Alex. I give Liam a quick glance, but otherwise ignore him, focusing all my attention on Alex and directing all my feelings toward him—still silently screaming ‘Jump!’

I fervently hope that the answer to the question, ‘If all your friends jump off the cliff, are you going to?’ is, ‘Yes, obviously.’

“Alex, do you remember what you spent all summer teaching me when I was five?” I ask softly.

He gives a quick nod.

“Do you remember why?”

Another nod.

“I need you to do it again.” I grab his hand. “Run!” I scream and pull us toward the cliff, but I’m already gone.

I’ve thrown the floodgates to my magic open in a way I’ve never allowed myself to do before. Everything, all at once, all directed at Iverson, all for the people I love.

The trick to it—and there’s always a trick to everything—is that I don’t need to win. I simply need to make sure Iverson can’t win either, and then trust the people around me to take care of the rest.

We’ll jump off the cliff, and Alex will make sure I don’t drown. Then once we’re in the water, Davy will make sure we get out and get away, and the others will help him get us somewhere safe. And once they do, if I’m very, very lucky, Liam will be able to figure out how to use the magic stretching between us to pull me back.

Until then, all I need to do is not lose.

Everything, all at once. My mind is already divorced from my body, and I’m throwing all of my magic around Iverson, tangling us together, binding us so tightly that neither of us can do anything, weaving my magic through and around both of our energy meridians and pulling it tighter and tighter and tighter—just like the snares for the rabbits, the more he struggles, the tighter it should get.

I need to make sure he can’t use his magic at all, and the only way I know how to accomplish that is to use mine to make such a tangled knot of both of our energy meridians that *neither* of us can do anything. Because if he can use his magic, he can stop Davy from getting us away from here. He could drop the cliff on them, or freeze the river, or sink the boats or a thousand other things, all of which result in us losing.

So like I did to Liam on the archery field, I grab onto Iverson and trust Alex, Davy, and now Liam to handle the rest.

I continue weaving my magic through Iverson’s with the sole goal of creating such a mess that we’re both mired in it for a good, long while. I’m distantly aware of the air rushing past me, and then being under water.

Then there’s nothing but darkness and the feeling of someone struggling against me, trying to shove me away but I hold on tighter. Then there’s pain, and more pain, but I keep holding on.

Then there’s nothing.

Just nothing.

Forever.

### 34 - No Light, No Light

“She’s still not awake,” I manage to grate out. Saying even that much feels like I’m trying to swallow shards of glass. “Three days, Davy. It’s been three damn days. You said she’d be awake by now.” I resist the urge to step into his personal space in an effort to intimidate him, primarily because I know it won’t have the desired effect, but also because doing so would likely put me that much closer to slamming a fist into his face.

“Try breathing,” Alex suggests from off to my left.

I feel my jaw clench as I resist directing my anger and fear at him instead.

“How could you let her do this?” I question, just shy of a roar, taking my ire out on Davy, who doesn’t even have the decency to try to defend himself.

“No one *lets* Hazel do anything,” Alex comments.

This time I round on him. “Shut the fuck up, Alex! No one asked for your input, and I don’t need a gods damned running commentary right now!”

He holds up his hands, stepping back half a pace as he lets out a sigh. “Fine. Be an asshole, then. But remember that you’re going to have to apologize to *everyone* when she wakes up,” he mutters.

“This is your fault, Davy. I swear, if she doesn’t wake up…” I don’t finish the thought mostly because I can’t.

“Actually, I’m pretty sure it’s *your* fault,” Gavin comments from the doorway, having just walked back into the room.

“Come again?” I ask slowly.

“You heard me,” Gavin answers, his voice as irritatingly cocksure as always. “But sure, Liam. I’ll say it again: It’s *your* fault. If you hadn’t gotten captured, Hazel wouldn’t have had to save your ass. If you’d been able to escape, she wouldn’t have had to take on Iverson for you. If you want to blame someone, you should go find a mirror.”

“Now you’ve done it,” Giorgi mutters from behind me as I launch myself at Gavin.

My relationship with Gavin can be tense at the best of times. We’re both too alike in all the wrong ways and completely different in all the rest. I’m not in the mood to deal with him, and I *am* in the mood to hit someone. He’s also a safer target than Davy.

I grab him around his waist as I slam my shoulder into him knocking him back a step. He’s already trying to twist away, but I keep driving forward until his back slams into the wall of the room behind him, pinning him in place momentarily, but he drives an elbow down into my upper back and I grunt in pain.

“Should we do something about this?” I hear Alex ask someone behind me. Probably Peter or Giorgi.

“Nope,” Peter comments disinterestedly.

“Nah,” Giorgi agrees.

Gavin’s hands are on my shoulders, shoving me back, but my hands are twisted around the fabric of his shirt and I pull him with me as I roll down onto my back, using the momentum to flip us both over so that when we stop moving I have him pinned. I land a solid hit to his jaw that sends his head rocking sideways before he twists beneath me and somehow manages to drive both feet into my solar plexus, sending me flying backwards unable to breathe.

“Are you done?” he interrogates derisively as he slowly stands, rubbing his jaw with one hand. After a moment, he extends the other out to me.

I look up at him angrily, and consider not taking it.

“Stop being an asshole,” Gavin demands, hand still extended out to me.

I reach up and grab it, allowing him to pull me back to my feet. “Fine,” I mutter, glaring at him.

“You win some, you lose some, Liam. Hazel knew what she was doing. Besides, it’s not like Davy could have stopped her.”

I scoff. “If you don’t think Davy could have stopped her, Gavin, you haven’t been paying attention. If he didn’t want her on that cliff, she wouldn’t have been there,” I say loudly enough for everyone to hear me because it’s damn well true.

Alex sighs loudly, and I turn on him.

“No, don’t you even fucking start, Alex. You *know* it’s true. You *know* it as well as I do, if not better. He could have stopped her if he’d wanted to.”

“You overestimate the authority I have over Hazel,” Davy finally says. They’re the first words he’s said in the more than thirty minutes my anger toward him has been clearly on display for everyone in the room.

“I’m not overestimating anything, Davy,” I tell him coldly. “Do you want to poll the room?”

“Do you really think she would have left you with him on my say so?” Davy asks.

“I think if you told her to, if you’d come up with *any* other plan, yeah. She would have.”

I look at Alex.

“Yeah. Maybe,” he responds with a shrug.

I know Alex is of the opinion that what’s done is done, but I’m finding that a little less easy to accept.

“Neither of us wanted to leave either of you with him. Is that what you want to hear me say?” Davy questions.

“No. I want you to say you know how to fix her!”

“Well, I don’t,” Davy replies, dropping his head to his hands and burrowing his fingers into his hair, sounding exhausted. “I have no gods damned idea what she did and I have no fucking idea how to fix it. I’ve been trying to work it out for the past three days, Liam. *You’re* the one who can feel her magic the best. You’re the one who’s *bound* to her, so why don’t you stop shouting at me and start trying to help me figure out how to fix it!” he rebukes acerbically, matching my anger and reflecting it back at me. “Whatever she did, she thought it was survivable—*fixable*—or she wouldn’t have done it.”

“He has a point,” Alex informs me.

“A good one,” Gavin agrees.

He does. It takes the wind out of my sails. I’m still not used to having magic as a tool I can use, and I honestly forget about it more often than not. The fact that I spent the last couple of days with malusium working its way out of my system doesn’t help either.

“Fine.”

I sit down on the bed next to Hazel’s limp body. We’re all crammed into a tiny three room flat Davy found, borrowed, or stole, and Hazel’s occupying the only bed. I’ve never seen her like this, and it terrifies me. There was that time in Ponchar, after she restored my memory, where she was asleep for three days, but that was different. I was also asleep for two of the three of those days, but more importantly she *looked* like she was asleep then.

Even in the pass when Davy tied her to her horse, then tied me to mine, and she was out for days, she didn’t look this bad. But she could have stopped that any time she wanted. I don’t think she can stop whatever this is.

Right now, she looks like she’s dying. Her complexion is sallow and she has dark circles under her eyes. She’s barely breathing. I continue to check that she’s alive, which merely serves to illustrate how irrational I’m being. If I’m alive, she must be too. I don’t need to check, but I keep doing it.

I wrap my palm around hers. It engulfs her entire hand. Her skin feels cold, and every time I touch her, I worry it’s going to be the last time. It’s hard to breathe around that thought. It feels like my chest is being squeezed from the inside out.

She’s getting thinner too. I can see the bones in her wrist sharply through her skin. She never completely regained all the weight she lost in the pass. I’m so worried I feel paralyzed.

“Liam, relax,” Alex comments from a chair he’s pulled up to the other side of the bed. “I meant it earlier when I said you should try breathing. If you can’t keep your own shit together, you’re not going to be able to help her.”

“I know,” I answer quietly. “I just don’t know how.”

“Stop thinking. That’s the trick to getting through the really bad stuff. You have to be able to *stop*. There was no before. There will be no after. There’s only now. Only the world as it is. When there’s nothing else to compare it to, it can’t be anything except for what it is, and what it is, is *fine*. Right here, right now, she’s fine. *Everything* is *fine*.”

“That’s—”

“Just try it, Liam. You have to be able to detach. Whether you’ve realized it or not, you’ve watched all three of us do it. We know a thing or two about this,” Alex says, sympathetically. “The rest of you can go find somewhere else to be,” he tells the others, in a tone that doesn’t leave any room for argument.

I take a breath. No before. No after.

“Fine. What do you want me to do?”

I see Alex glance at Davy, and Davy gives him a small nod, indicating Alex should run the show. I’m not sure if it’s because Davy thinks Alex will do a better job, or if he’s worried I’ll lose what little composure I have if he starts talking to me.

“Can you feel the magic connecting the two of you?”

“Yes.”

“Okay, good. Can you touch it at all?”

“Yes.”

“Does it look any different?”

“I don’t know. I don’t think so,” I state. I wish I was better at this. For the first time, I wish I’d spent my entire life learning how to do this. How am I the best tool for this? There’s no way I’m going to be able to do what they’re asking. I have no idea about any of this.

“Liam,” Alex begins, getting my attention, “whatever you’re thinking, stop.”

I inhale sharply but nod, running my thumb over the skin on the back of her hand. It’s so cold. No one alive should be this cold.

“What are you doing?” Davy asks.

“Nothing,” I reply, staring at my hand wrapped around hers.

“Okay, well keep doing that. What happened last time?”

“Last time what?” I inquire, as my eyes remain on our hands.

“When Alex asked if you could touch the magic binding you and Hazel together, you didn’t have to think about it or check. So what happened last time you touched it?”

“Nothing.”

“Liam—” Davy begins.

“No, Davy. Stop.” Alex orders. “Liam’s and Hazel’s magic has always intrinsically responded to one another. Leave it alone.”

The three of us sit clustered around Hazel and the silence is the loudest thing in the room as seconds stretch into minutes.

“We know whatever Hazel did, she thought it could be undone, and I’m pretty sure she thought you could undo it,” Alex tells me.

“We don’t know that,” I mutter as I look back at him.

Alex and I don’t look anything alike, but his eyes look so much like Hazel’s—midnight blue and rimmed by thick, dark lashes—that I can’t force myself to meet his gaze for more than a few seconds before looking away.

“You might not. But Davy and I know. And we know it was you, because if it was one of us she would have told me on the cliff, but all she told me was what she needed from me then, and she’d already told Davy what she needed from him. That leaves you, Liam.”

“I have no idea what I’m supposed to do or how I’m supposed to do it! Everything magic is the three of you.”

“You know more about the magic binding you to Hazel than anyone,” Davy tells me. “You know more than I do, more than Alex, and I’m pretty sure you know more than Hazel does. *She* believed you could fix it. So start trying to fix it.”

“I don’t—”

“It doesn’t matter,” Davy interjects, cutting me off. “If you want her back, you’re going to have to figure it out.”

This conversation is getting us nowhere, so I stop talking. I focus on the physical sensation of Hazel’s hand in mine and, underlying that, the magic connecting us to one another. It almost feels a little bit brighter at the spot where our hands meet.

I sigh, releasing her hand as I slide one arm under her shoulders and the other under her legs and lift her, cradling her limp body against my chest. I’m reminded of all the other times we’ve been in this same position. I find myself taking a bit of solace in the fact that this isn’t the first time we’ve been here and, in the end, she’s been fine the other times. I hope that means she’ll be fine this time too, but another part of me is wondering how many times we can be that lucky. *I just need her to be okay,* I think as I remember the first time I found her unconscious on the rooftop after Alex… before I knew who she really was or that he existed. Things were so much easier then, but there’s not any part of me which wants to go back to that.

I close my eyes as I remember that day, and I try to let the memories flow along the magic binding us together. I was trying to explain. To apologize. But it all kept coming out wrong, and I could see her getting angrier and angrier. Then the look on her face when I accused her of using my feelings for her against me. I’m not sure I’ve done or said anything else in my life that made me feel like a shittier human being than I did when I saw her reaction to that statement.

Then she left. She just left. Almost instantly I realized how badly I’d screwed up. I wanted to take it all back and apologize, only by the time I figured out how to follow her and worked up the nerve to do so, she was lying in a crumpled heap on the roof, and I had no idea what to do. There was nothing wrong with her but she was completely unresponsive. I carried her to Davy’s because I had no idea what else to do. Compared to now, she seemed like the picture of health.

I try to stop the memory of her on the cliffs from bubbling back to the surface, but running over the events of that night has become a well worn groove in my mind during the past few days, and I can’t quite prevent it from happening.

I was still halfway drugged. Peter even more so, I think. Alex seemed to be recovering better than either of us. Probably because of all the shit their mother did to them as children. When I saw Hazel standing there, it was like something flared in my chest, and the closer I got to her the more it seemed like I could feel the magic between us crackling back to life.

Then everything happened so fast. She gave me a fleeting smile, said a few words to Alex and then screamed at us to run. I was jumping off the edge of a cliff before I had even half a second to consider what I was doing or think better of it. I hit the water, and by the time I surfaced, Alex was already swimming toward the boats with Hazel in tow, keeping her head above the water. At first, I thought it wouldn’t be long until she woke up, but once I got into the boat with her, nothing about her felt right. It was like there was no light at all around her anymore, where before there had always been a bonfire.

She hasn’t opened her eyes since.

----

Someone is shaking me.

“Stop drooling on my sister.”

“What?” I mutter groggily.

My head has fallen forward and my cheek is pressed into the top of Hazel’s head. My mouth feels like I’ve been eating sand, and I have a crick in my neck from the awkward position I’ve been in for who knows how long.

“Wake up and eat something,” Alex tells me.

I look down at Hazel. “She’s still the same.”

“No,” Peter disagrees from across the room, apparently having come back at some point. “She definitely looks better than she did. Less gray.”

“Yeah,” Gavin agrees. “She looks a lot less like a corpse than she did when we left.”

Giorgi elbows him.

“What? It’s true,” he says, rubbing at his ribs.

“Yeah,” Amelia agrees from where she’s standing next to Peter. “Definitely better. Whatever you did seems like it helped.”

I’m skeptical. “I didn’t *do* anything.”

“That’s what you always say,” Alex tells me. “And yet,” he gestures at Hazel in my arms. “Set her down, come eat something, and see for yourself.”

I follow his advice, gingerly moving her off of me. My legs tingle as blood rushes back into them after having been in the same position for so long. Finally, when the tingling stops, I stand and go over to the table, which is arrayed with chicken, and an assortment of roasted vegetables.

I look back at Hazel, and I think she *might* look a little bit better, but I’m not certain that it’s not merely a trick of the late evening light lending her a bit more color. I can’t help but sigh.

“Where’s Davy?” I ask as I take a piece of chicken.

“Out on the balcony,” Alex answers. “Don’t throw him off of it,” he calls after me as I walk toward it.

I give him the finger as I continue walking in the direction of the balcony.

Davy’s elbows are resting on the railing, and he’s leaning over it looking down. He glances up when he hears the door open, and quickly glances back down when he sees it’s me.

I lean over the railing next to him. “I only came to say sorry. Not to pick another fight,” I state by way of explanation. “Gavin and Alex were right. I was being an asshole and you didn’t deserve it. None of this is your fault. Blaming you isn’t fair to you or to Hazel.”

I see a little bit of tension leave Davy’s body when he realizes I’m not here to yell at him some more.

“You’re not wrong. I should have found another way, but I couldn’t see one. I still can’t, and I’ve done nothing but replay every decision I’ve made over the past five days,” he says softly.

“Neither did she. If she thought there was a better way, she wouldn’t have been up there.”

It’s true Davy has a lot of sway over both Alex and Hazel. But I also know Davy and Hazel don’t always agree, and when they don’t, Hazel tends to do what she thinks is best, not what Davy does.

“Are you okay?” I ask, really looking at him for the first time in days. He doesn’t look great. He’s been losing weight too, and I’m not sure he’s slept at all since we got here.

“I’m fi—” he starts.

“Davy, don’t give me that same bullshit you’re all always repeating about being fine. *None* of you are fine.”

He shakes his head.

“What?” I pry.

“Don’t.”

“Don’t what?”

“We are *all* fine, Liam,” he tells me firmly. “The only way we all hold it together is by being fine, so don’t.”

“Fine,” I agree for now.

“Hazel looks better,” he comments, echoing the others and changing the subject.

“Maybe. I’m not sure.”

“She does. Whatever you were doing, you should keep doing it.”

“I wasn’t doing anything,” I reiterate.

Davy shrugs.

----

I spend most of the next two days cradling Hazel’s limp body. I swear I’m not doing anything, but she does look better. Even I’m seeing it by this point. She still hasn’t woken up, though. It’s been five days now, and while she looks better, my fear isn’t abating the longer this goes on.

There’s also the matter of Reese. I know Peter has continued looking for her, and come up empty so far. I haven’t been able to help and that’s been eating at me too. I can’t be totally sure Iverson didn’t take her, but based on the two and a half days we spent as his unwilling guests, I don’t think he did. I think he used her absence to his advantage and I was stupid enough to fall for it.

Gavin was right when he said I should be blaming myself for all of this.

“Amelia, can you go talk to Michael? See if he knows anything about Reese?” I ask.

“Funny. Hazel wanted us to do the same thing before all this,” she informs me, gesturing at our current cramped quarters. “Yeah, fine,” she agrees.

“Take Giorgi and Henry with you.”

“Sure,” she responds, as she gets up to leave.

I lean my head back against the wall behind me and stare up at the ceiling feeling useless, and thinking of every choice I would make differently if I had it to do over again.

“Stop feeling sorry for yourself, Liam,” Alex orders from the other side of the room.

“Stop listening in on my feelings. If I wanted to discuss them with you, I’d be talking to you,” I reply. I think since he’s unable to tease Hazel and get his fill of petty arguments with her, he’s using me as the stand-in sibling, and it’s getting incredibly annoying.

“I felt that too.”

“Not my problem.”

He sighs. “I think you should try something new.”

“Like what?”

“Well, you keep saying you’re not doing anything…”

“Right. Because I’m not.”

“You definitely have been, but that’s neither here nor there. The magic that’s binding you together, you said you can touch it, right?”

“Yes.”

“Try using it to pull her toward you,” Alex suggests.

“It’s not… I don’t know if…”

“Why—ah. I see.”

“Stay out of my head, Alex,” I growl.

He grins. “But it’s so entertaining in there.”

“I have no idea how Hazel puts up with you.”

“She’d probably tell you that you’ll get used to it,” he shrugs. “Anyway, if you can use it for… other things, I don’t see why you wouldn’t be able to use it for this. Try.”

### 35 - Breathe Me

I feel like I’ve been floating in silent darkness forever. There’s no wind. No temperature. No smell. No up. No down. No anything. It’s formless. I’d say I was lost, but there’s nothing here, so being lost seems technically impossible.

I remember what was happening. I remember everything. I remember Iverson fighting against me, and the distant feel of the water as we hit it. I remember seeing Liam before that, and the relief I felt, even though I already *knew* he was okay.

I *remember* everything, but I don’t *know* anything. I don’t know how I got here, and I don’t know how to get out. I don’t even know where ‘here’ is. I don’t know what happened to Iverson when I entered this nothing, and I don’t know what happened to me either.

There’s no magic here, and I don’t know if that’s *because* there’s no magic here, the way there’s no temperature, no ground, and no sky or if it’s because I broke myself with what I did. I can’t even feel the magic binding me to Liam, which has been omnipresent since its inception.

There’s nothing.

I’m not sure how long I’ve been here. I have no idea if time is moving very slowly, or very quickly. I haven’t been hungry, thirsty, or tired since I’ve been here. I’m honestly not even totally sure if I’m corporeal or if I’m an idea trapped in my own head. I keep trying to feel my body and I think, for brief moments, I do. But then the idea of it collapses like a sandcastle that’s too close to the water, and I can’t tell if I’ve imagined it or not.

I’m going to go crazy if I can’t find a way out of here—if Liam can’t find a way to get me out. Because I think he’s the only one who might be able to. I have no idea how Alex or Davy could even find me. It’s solely the connection Liam has to me which might allow him to do it, and that’s assuming it’s intact outside of this place.

I could be dead, but I’m pretty sure I’m not. *Being* dead seems like the kind of thing you’d be sure of, and I definitely don’t *feel* dead. What I feel, is really fucking annoyed.

I’m annoyed at myself for ending up in whatever state I’m currently in. I’m annoyed that somehow I didn’t manage to pull Iverson here with me. I don’t know if he’s elsewhere in a similar state—I hope he is, but for all I know he might have managed to keep himself out of it somehow. I’m annoyed that it’s taking Liam so long to get me out of here, even though I don’t actually know that it is. For all I know, only five minutes have passed in the real world.

I want to yell, but it doesn’t seem to have any effect. I’ve tried. And I don’t even know if that’s because I don’t have a voice, or if it’s because this place is sucking the sound out of my words before they even have a chance to become audible. The not knowing is maddening.

If this was a room, I’d be banging my fists against the door in rage, but even that’s denied to me because there is no door, and because I possibly don’t have hands.

That’s the weirdest part of it all: not knowing if I have a body, and not being able to look to see it, or even reach down and touch it.

I am currently as formless as this place is. I hate it. It vexes me terribly.

----

I feel like a hundred years have gone by. Maybe even a thousand. I’m starting to feel like I never existed anywhere else. I think I’m starting to forget, and I feel like forgetting would be a very bad thing in this place. I’m just not sure why. And I’m not sure if that’s because I’ve forgotten, or because I never knew.

I feel like there’s so much I’ve forgotten. My name is Hazel. I know that. I know it was dark before I came here. And I know I’m waiting for someone. Or I think I am. I hope I am. I don’t want to be here all alone forever. That seems… undesirable.

I am a person. People are supposed to be with other people. I’m pretty sure that’s one of those rules, or something.

I wish I knew how I got here.

I wish I knew how long I was going to be here.

----

The darkness seems darker. I’m not sure how long it’s seemed darker, but I don’t like it. I think it’s another bad sign. I think there are only bad signs here.

I don’t think I’m ever going to get out of here. Getting out of here implies that there is somewhere else. Another place. But I don’t remember being anywhere else. I think I’ve been here forever.

Except… there’s somewhere else. Right? Right…?

----

There’s a person called Hazel. Or maybe there used to be? I’m not sure.

----

Me. I’m the person called Hazel. I’m a person. I have a name. There are other people. Lots of other people. It’s not just me. I mean, here it is. Here, it’s just me. But somewhere there are other people. Other people who I need to get back to. Liam and Alex and Davy. They’re people like me. They’re *my* people. There are others too. Only I can’t remember them. Yet. I can’t remember them *yet.* But I think maybe I will?

Maybe?

----

The darkness seems less dark. I think it’s been less dark for a while. But it’s hard to tell. I need to get out of here.

I know who I am again. I think I forgot for a while, which seems like a very bad thing, but now I know who I am again, and that seems… better. I think.

But I need to get out of here. I can’t stay here. It feels like maybe the barrier between this place and everywhere else is getting thinner. Like maybe soon I’ll be able to break through it. Or would be able to if I had a body.

How do you get a body? A body is a thing you just *have*. Where is mine? How do I get it back?

Liam is the one who can get me out. I’m sure of it. I focus everything I can on thoughts of him.

The annoying way he’s always asking questions. So many questions. Questions about me, questions about magic, questions about us, questions about Davy, questions about Alex, questions I don’t want to answer. Only now maybe I do want to answer them.

I think about the way his eyes crinkle slightly when he laughs. I think about the way his body engulfs mine. I think about the way I lose all desire to be anywhere else the second he wraps his arms around me. I think about how stubborn he can be when he thinks he’s right, or when he thinks I’m wrong. I think about the way he’s always trying to keep me safe, even though I’m so much more powerful than he is—so much more powerful than he can even begin to understand—and the irony that I need him to come to my rescue now is not lost on me. I think about the look on his face that night we made paper lanterns and watched them float away.

I think about falling in love with him, and I hold onto that thought with everything I can.

I feel the magic binding us together flare, and as soon as I do, I’m grasping at it like it’s a life preserver, because I’m pretty sure it is. It feels like I’m being pulled. I’m just not sure if I’m being pulled out of here, or pulled apart. I don’t think it matters though, because either way it’s something different. And right now, different is good. Different is life. Or maybe death. But hopefully life.

I think maybe I hear screaming, and maybe I feel pressure.

I think I’m alive.

### 36 - The Great Escape

“Try,” Alex demands again when I don’t immediately respond.

Alex isn’t quite as impatient as Hazel, but he’s not far off either. It makes me wonder, because Alexandria doesn’t seem impatient at all. She seems like a snake hidden at the base of a rock—cold-blooded and content to lie in wait forever if that’s what it takes, and neither Alex nor Hazel are like that.

“If it was you, Hazel would try,” he pushes.

I know she would. At least I can be sure that if this is the wrong move, and it makes the situation worse, we’ll both end up dead. I won’t have to live knowing I made the wrong decision and caused her death.

“Fine,” I mutter. “I’ll try. How hard do you think I should… pull on it?”

“As hard as you need to. If she was able to wake up on her own, she would have done it already. And she looks generally better now, so I don’t think you need to worry about…” Alex waves a hand ambiguously in the air.

“So you don’t think I need to worry about *what*, Alex?”

“Killing her because she’s too frail to take the stress of it.”

“Great. Thanks for that,” I say, sighing.

“She’d still do it. She’d still tell *you* to do it.”

“I know.”

“There’s nothing to it but to do it.”

I echo his words, “There’s nothing to it but to do it.” The times I’ve heard Hazel say those same eight words flicker through my memory.

I reach out for the magic binding us together. It looks the same as ever: a web of glimmering, golden strands woven around me and across to her. When we’re this close together it practically seems to glow with its own inner light. Except for that first night, I haven’t tried to actively do anything with or to this magic.

But Alex is right. If she was going to wake up on her own, she would have done it by now. I wrap my arms around her a little bit tighter. Then I begin pulling on the connection between us.

At first, all I feel is resistance. It feels like I’m pulling on a rope that’s anchored to a wall, and it’s not going to move. Following Alex’s advice, I pull harder. I keep increasing the intensity with which I’m pulling until it seems like I finally feel the resistance give, just a little bit. I continue pulling, but then Hazel starts screaming.

“Don’t stop,” Alex tells me over her screaming.

*Don’t stop?* I think incredulously, because I’m pretty sure I should stop. This isn’t a sound a person makes when you should keep doing whatever is causing them to make that sound. It sounds like the kind of sound I imagine a person would make if their skin was being flayed from their body while they’re still alive.

“Liam, don’t stop!”

I force myself to continue, but then she starts seizing. She’s thrashing and shaking violently within my arms. I can see her tendons flexing at her joints beneath her skin, and at this point I definitely think I’m doing more harm than good. She both looks and sounds like she’s in agony. I have to stop.

“*Liam, don’t stop!*” Alex repeats, and this time it’s not a suggestion.

He’s put so much power behind the words that I have no say in the matter. I’m trying to disengage, but I can’t. This is so much worse than what Hazel did to me in the park all those months ago. That was like inadvertently inhaling a sip of water and being unable to breathe. This feels like I’m being held under a tidal wave, unable to surface and not even entirely sure which direction is up and which is down.

I want to stop, because what I’m doing is definitely hurting Hazel, but I can’t. All I can do is continue to pull on the magic binding us together as her seizure grows in intensity. I’m trying to shove the weight of Alex’s command away from me. Off of me. But I can’t. It’s holding me trapped against the seafloor of my own mind, and I think he’s going to kill us both.

All of a sudden, the pressure gives like a soap bubble popping, and Hazel falls silent. She’s still. So still. I’m not sure if she’s alive or if she’s died and I’ll be momentarily following. But then the pressure I feel holding me prisoner within my own mind relents as well.

“I’m going to—”

“*Go to sleep, Liam,*” Alex orders, seeing me moving to stand, and evidently drawing the appropriate conclusion.

The world goes dark.

----

“Alex, what did you do to him?” someone hoarsely coughs out.

It kind of sounds like Hazel’s voice, but it can’t be because Hazel hasn’t said anything in days. She hasn’t been awake in days.

“I made sure he did what needed to be done.”

“Alex.” She sounds reproachful. “We told him we wouldn’t do that to him again.”

“No. *You* said *you* wouldn’t do that to him again. *I* never said anything of the sort. Would you have preferred I let him stop?”

*Why can’t I open my eyes?*

“No,” she answers softly. It’s barely a whisper.

“Well, then. You’re welcome. Besides, if you truly meant that, you would have taught him how to stop it from happening.”

“Let him go,” she sighs.

My eyes open and I see Hazel’s face swimming just out of focus in front of me. I blink quickly several times to clear my vision and bring her into focus.

“You… You’re alive!” The relief I feel is palpable. I bring my hands to her face to reassure myself she’s real. That this isn’t some dreamscape hallucination. There’s never any texture in dreams, and I can feel her skin beneath my fingers. She’s real. I’m awake. She’s awake!

She presses her lips to mine. They’re dry and chapped from spending so long unconscious with so little fluids, but they’re real.

“I’m alive,” she says, pulling away. Her eyes look haunted.

“Are you okay?” I ask resting my forehead against hers.

“I will be,” she responds, but she sounds more unsure of herself than I’ve ever heard her sound.

“Okay,” I agree, not wanting to push too hard. “Alex, get her some water,” I bark out. “How long have you been awake?”

“Not long. A few minutes before you,” she answers, resting her head on my chest and letting her eyes fall closed.

I fight the knee-jerk reaction to tell her not to do that. It’s going to be a while before I’m going to be able to see her asleep without worrying. I run a hand over her hair.

“Would you be terribly upset if I killed him?” I question just to keep her talking.

“No,” she sighs. “He’s your brother too. You can kill him if you want.”

She sounds impossibly tired for someone who spent the last five days sleeping, but I don’t ask, yet.

“Hazel,” Alex snaps, waiting for her to open her eyes. “Water, then food, then sleep. You know how this works.”

She takes the glass he’s holding out to her and drains it.

“Happy?” she asks, handing it back, her voice sounding slightly less gravelly.

“Only marginally. Why didn’t you teach Liam how to keep us out?” Alex interrogates.

I get the impression he doesn’t particularly care what the answer is. He simply wants her awake and talking.

“Never really had time,” she mumbles quietly into my chest.

“Hazel,” Alex scoffs, “if you’d wanted to teach him you would have found time.”

He’s baiting her now, I’m sure of it.

“I just didn’t, okay?” she snaps angrily.

Based on the look on Alex’s face, I’m not the only one confused by the heat in her response. Hazel can be mercurial, but a comment like that isn’t enough to upset her. I look at Alex in question, but he merely shrugs.

“Hazel, what’s wrong?” I prod.

“Nothing,” she states softly. “Where are Davy and Giorgi?”

“Why?” Alex asks.

“Just… Where are they?”

“Giorgi went with Amelia and Henry to talk to Michael. We still don’t know where Reese is,” I tell her by way of an explanation.

“Reese… I forgot,” she says quietly.

“Davy’s on his way back now,” Alex answers. “Food?”

“I’d prefer a bath.”

“Food first, and then you can have a bath.”

“Fine,” she grumbles, moving to stand.

She makes it to her feet, but sways as she stands. I wrap an arm around her waist to steady her.

“Thanks,” she murmurs, and we slowly walk to the table together.

“Are you going to tell me why you want to talk to Davy and Giorgi?” Alex tries again.

“I want to ask them a question.”

“You want to ask Davy *and* Giorgi a question. How intriguing. Do you know what she wants to ask them, Liam?”

“No,” I answer. But whatever it is, I suspect it’s what she’s angry about.

“Hmm.”

### 37 - Body Parts

I obediently eat the toast Alex puts in front of me. I feel drained and I can sense the questions that have both Alex and Liam ready to burst. Questions I really don’t have it in me to answer right now. All I want is to either take a bath and fall asleep in Liam’s arms, or to have Davy and Giorgi in front of me so I can hold their feet to the fire—either metaphorically or literally. I don’t care which. I need my question answered even though I’m pretty sure I know the answer now. Even though I wish I didn’t. I need to hear them say it. I need to hear them tell me what I’m pretty sure I already know, and I desperately hope they won’t.

I swallow the last bite of toast and have a few more sips of water to wash it down. “There, can I have a bath now?”

“Yes, if Liam goes with you,” Alex answers.

“I don’t need help bathing.”

“I don’t care what you think you need. I’m not going to have you cracking your skull open in the bathroom because you were being stubborn. Either Liam can help you or I will, and I think we would all prefer if it was him,” Alex says leaving no room for argument.

“Fine. Whatever. I hate you.”

“I hate you too, sis,” he responds, grinning.

Liam helps me stand, and walks with me slowly to the bathroom. I sit on the side of the tub and begin the process of pulling my clothes off, while Liam fills the tub for me. It feels so much more taxing than it should. *Everything* feels so much more taxing than it should.

“How many days has it been since the cliff?” I ask Liam now that we’re alone.

“Five days. I thought you were going to die,” he says softly and his voice sounds haunted.

“For a while, I thought I might too,” I admit. It’s barely a whisper. I think that’s the closest I’ve actually ever come to dying, although I don’t tell Liam that.

“What happened?”

“I don’t know,” I answer as I turn to slide into the water. “Not exactly, anyway. I’ll explain what I can later, but I don’t have it in me to do it right now.”

“Okay.”

I sink below the surface of the water letting it rush over my face and hair, almost as soon as I do, Liam’s hands are reaching into the tub pulling me up.

“Don’t. Please.”

The pleading tone in his voice stops my initial response which was going to be some form of sputtering protest.

“Do you want to get in?” I ask instead. “Come on,” I urge when I see his hesitation. “It’s big enough for both of us.”

“Alright,” he agrees, stripping off his clothes.

I let my eyes roam over his body, admiring the view from his wide, rounded shoulders down his chest, to his abs—which are clearly visible in this lighting—and over his lean hips to the mound of hair between them and his dick that I’m pretty sure I could have hard in a matter of minutes, finally taking in his lean, muscular legs.

“Are you getting in?” I demand impatiently.

“I don’t know. You seem to be enjoying the view.”

“I am,” I confirm, “but I’d enjoy it more if you were in here with me.”

“Slide forward,” he says before dropping into the tub behind me.

I lean back against his chest and he wraps his arms around me. We stay like that long enough that the water begins to cool. I’m not actually sure if I can warm it back up. I have no idea what state my magic is in. I know the connection to Liam is still there, but that’s it. In that formless darkness, I couldn’t do any magic, but I have no idea what, if anything, that means for me in the here and now. I take a breath and decide to find out.

I use one hand to create a small whirlpool in the water, and then use that as a focal point to direct heat into the water because I have a feeling I’m going to need all the help I can get. And slowly, much more slowly than it should, the water heats up, and damn it hurts.

I hiss as I cut off the power flow.

“Are you okay?” Liam questions, and I hear the concern laced through his words.

“I don’t know,” I answer, truthfully. “Reheating the water hurt a lot more than it should have. I wasn’t sure I’d be able to do it, so pain is better than nothing, I guess.”

“Hazel. You just woke up. Maybe give it a day or two.”

“I had to know.”

“Had to know what?” he asks, curiously.

“If I could.”

“Why wouldn’t you be able to?”

“I was there for so long. No magic. No anything. Barely even me. I had to know if I still could,” I whisper.

“It was only five days,” he reminds me softly, his hand resting on my hip beneath the water.

“No. It was forever. I don’t want to talk about it. I just had to know if I could,” I say, fighting away the panic of the memory of being locked in that place.

“Okay. We won’t talk about it. Breathe,” he tells me, entwining a hand with mine and bringing his lips down to kiss the top of my shoulder.

“Now, that’s something I wouldn’t mind doing,” I inform him, craning my head back to find his lips.

His mouth is gentle on mine at first, but I’m insistent and he gives in, his lips parting and his tongue stroking across mine hungrily. This angle is terrible for anything longer than a few seconds, so I rotate so I’m facing him, straddling his hips beneath the water. His hand moves up my hip, and over my waist before reaching my breast, gently caressing it. I moan softly as I rock against him a bit more, but he drops his hand and pulls back slightly.

“We shouldn’t,” he states, sounding a touch breathless.

“No, we absolutely should,” I counter, punctuating each word by trailing my lips over his jaw and down his throat.

“You just woke up.”

“Yes, and?”

“You should probably spend some time recovering.”

“Yes, I agree, this will count as part of my recovery,” I reply, letting my hands run over his chest.

“But Alex—”

“First of all,” I begin, “let’s not talk about my brother while we’re naked in the bath together. But second, he’s the one who told you—no, basically ordered you—to come in here and get me naked. Believe me, he knew exactly where that would lead. I bet he’s already soundproofed this room. Feel free to check. I’ll wait,” I finish, dropping a hand below the water to wrap around him.

He moans as I apply pressure and begin stroking him. I see him trying to focus, but he doesn’t ask me to stop, so I don’t. After a moment, his mouth is back on mine with a new intensity.

“I take it I’m right then?” I ask when we break apart.

“Yes,” he growls, dropping his mouth to my breast.

“Good,” I moan. “That means I don’t have to be quiet.”

I swear I feel him somehow grow even harder. And he drops a hand beneath the water between my thighs, brushing his fingertips over my clit with the lightest possible touch, eliciting an aching cry of need from me.

*This* is exactly what I need, and apparently exactly what Liam needs too. I need to feel him inside of me and to feel myself wrapped around him, to let go of everything that’s happened before and everything that might happen in the future.

I’m not sure if he’s lifting me onto him, or if it’s me, and it doesn’t matter.

“You’re all I ever want,” he tells me as he pulls me down onto him, fingers still stroking over me.

My mouth finds his again, and my hands wrap into his hair, as I allow him to set the pace. I simply want to be closer to him. The combination of his body under and inside of mine, his hands caressing the most sensitive parts of me, and his mouth on mine winds me tighter and tighter until ecstasy is crashing around me like twelve foot waves.

In one move, he lifts me off of him and spins me so I’m kneeling in the water in front of him, and my hands grip the edge of the tub in front of me to keep me balanced as he comes to his knees behind me. His hands are on my hips as he slides back into me, and with this new angle he’s so deep inside of me it’s an entirely different sensation. I rock back into him to get even more, and he holds me there momentarily before he begins moving again.

“This is exactly what I want,” I tell him breathlessly. “Forever.”

His hands tighten around my hips before he’s finding his own release in a series of shuddering thrusts which leave us both spent.

Eventually, he slides out of me and pulls me back against his chest as we both lie bonelessly in the water that’s gone tepid again. I don’t have the energy to warm it back up. Despite that, I find myself wistfully saying, “Let’s stay here forever.”

“Mmm,” Liam says, his fingers tracing across my shoulder leisurely. After a few more minutes, he says, “As much as I would love that, I think we should get you out of here. The water’s getting cold anyway.”

“Alright,” I agree, letting him help me out of the tub. I sit on the edge as he hands me a towel. “You look better. I think you needed that as much as I did.”

“Maybe.”

“Can you check outside the door? See if there are clean clothes?”

“You think Alex left clothes?” Liam queries.

“Maybe. That’s why I want you to check,” I say with raised eyebrows.

Liam comes back carrying two new sets of clothes. “How did you know?”

“I didn’t,” I answer.

“Where did he get these?” Liam wonders.

“You don’t ask the goblin where he got his gold.”

“What?”

“Nothing,” I say, waving the question away. “Just a line from an old bedtime story.”

----

“You’re alive,” Peter says when Liam and I walk out of the bathroom.

I nod. “I’m alive.”

“Thanks for rescuing us.”

“Such as it was,” I mutter. “You’re welcome,” I respond more loudly. “Can we talk later? Just the two of us?”

“Okay,” Peter agrees, but he sounds uncertain, almost as if he already wants to take it back.

“Hazel!” Gavin shouts half a second before his arms wrap around me and he lifts me off of my feet in a spin.

“She just woke up,” Liam grumbles, as he reaches out for my arm to steady me when Gavin sets me down. “Maybe don’t spin her around.”

“Please,” Gavin scoffs. “She’s fine!”

Liam sighs.

“Where is Davy?” I ask.

“Here,” he calls from behind me.

I turn to find him leaning a shoulder against the wall next to the window.

“Davy. You’ve looked better,” I comment, giving him a once over.

“Likewise,” he tells me.

My face splits into a grin. I am unbelievably angry at him, but I’m still so relieved to see his face. That might all change later, when I hear what he has to say for himself, because if Giorgi’s right—and I think he is—Davy’s been keeping secrets. *Big* secrets. Things he should have told me. Things I had every right to know.

For now though, I walk over to him and wrap my arms around him in a hug. “I’m glad you’re alive. You can remind me I said that later,” I say softly as I step away.

“Later?”

“Yes. Later. If it so happens I’m threatening to kill you,” I tell him as I turn and head back toward Liam, not waiting to hear his response or see his expression.

“Food!” I hear Alex call from the entry.

I dutifully sit down at the table.

----

Halfway through my second plate of food, Amelia, Giorgi, and Henry return.

“Hazel!” Amelia practically squeals, sounding a lot more thrilled to see me than I would have expected. “You’re alive!”

“I’m alive,” I confirm again.

“I’m so glad you woke up.” She grins. “*Today.*”

She holds out a hand to Henry, who hands over some money with a sigh. Then Giorgi, Gavin, and Peter all do the same.

“You won?” I ask.

“I won,” she gloats.

“You were all betting on when she would wake up?” Liam questions softly, but with an unmistakable hint of violence in his tone.

“It’s not like there was a whole lot else to do,” Gavin responds with a shrug. “I had the second day by the way, Hazel. You really let me down.”

“Sorry?” I say with a snort.

“My money was on tomorrow,” Henry tells me.

I fight down the urge to shudder at the thought of another day in that place. “Well, what about you two, then?” I ask looking between Peter and Giorgi.

“Day three,” Giorgi answers.

“Day four,” Peter tells me.

“I can’t believe you were all betting on when she would wake up,” Liam growls.

“I can’t believe I wasn’t invited to be part of the betting pool,” Alex laments. “Did you know about this?” he asks Davy.

“Yes.”

“We thought it would be in poor taste to include you, Alex,” Gavin comments.

“It’s like you all don’t even know me,” Alex sighs in response.

### 38 - Crucify

I finally finish eating. I had three full plates of food and I think it may have been a mistake. My stomach feels like it’s going to burst, and I’m not sure but I think it’s possible I only had that last plate to delay the inevitable.

“Can we get onto the roof?” I ask. I want to know because kicking everyone else out so I can have this conversation in private seems wrong. But I definitely don’t want to have it in front of everyone.

“Yes,” Giorgi confirms, and for some reason I get the impression that he may have specifically checked for me, before I even woke up.

“Great,” I sigh, in a tone that is anything but. “Giorgi, Davy, I want to talk to you on the roof. *Only* Giorgi and Davy,” I specify before Liam and Alex can invite themselves along.

“Hazel,” Giorgi says softly. “Alex and Liam should come.”

“No.”

“They deserve to know.”

Perfect. Now everyone is looking back and forth between Giorgi and me, turning a conversation which may have gone unremarked upon into a conversation that will very much be remarked upon.

“What’s going on?” Gavin wants to know.

“Nothing,” Giorgi and I answer together.

His response to Gavin makes me relent a little bit.

“Fine, let’s go,” I reluctantly agree.

Davy sighs as we all stand. I’m not sure if he’s figured out yet *why* I’m mad, or if he merely knows from my earlier comments that I’m mad at him. Alex and Liam look perplexed—I think they’re as confused by Giorgi’s behavior as they are by mine. Giorgi’s the only one who looks unfazed. I don’t even want to know what look my own face is wearing.

Giorgi leads the way to the staircase that goes to the roof and I follow him up. All the food I’ve eaten is weighing heavy in my stomach as Davy, Alex, and Liam trail behind me.

“The door,” I tell Davy flatly, once we’re all on the roof.

He sighs but nods in acquiescence.

“How long have you known?” I ask, rounding on Giorgi.

He doesn’t ask what I’m referring to. He already knows. “I’ve suspected it since Leisch,” he says softly. “But I wasn’t sure until Lisette.”

Gods damned Lisette. “The fucking stones,” I mutter.

He nods.

“And you didn’t say anything?” I’m shouting now.

“It wasn’t my place,” he inclines his head subtly towards Davy.

“And you’re sure he knows?” I demand, talking about Davy like he isn’t here.

“Pretty sure,” Giorgi responds.

“How could you not tell me?” I shout, turning to Davy now.

“Not tell you what, *exactly*?” Davy probes carefully.

“You know what!”

“I’m not sure I do,” he informs me in that same careful tone.

He’s just being an asshole now. He’s going to make me say it. I want to shove him off the roof, but I know I’d regret it later. Mostly though, I can’t make myself move. My feet feel like they’re bolted to the rooftop and my mouth feels like it’s a desert.

I can’t quite make myself get the next words out, and seeing my hesitation Davy chides, “You know better than to ask the goblin where he got his gold, Hazel.”

The words feel like a slap in the face, and I think I feel something inside of me breaking. The world goes wavy in front of my eyes and the center of my face feels like a hot, prickling mess as I resist the urge to howl.

I glance sideways to where Alex and Liam are standing across from Giorgi. Liam’s mouth has fallen open and his eyes are darting back and forth between me and Davy. I guess he’s worked it out now, too. I never wanted him to know. *I* never wanted to know.

“What question doesn’t she want the answer to, Davy?” Alex asks slowly.

Davy simply stares at me, waiting to see if I’ll ask it. I can’t force the words out now, and tears are streaming down my face.

Giorgi takes pity on me, and says in a voice barely louder than a whisper, “Alexandria might not be able to see the future, but Hazel can.”

Davy’s eyes flick sideways to Giorgi, and I get the sense Davy is restraining himself from violence as he states, “They both can, actually. That’s why she’s… the way she is.”

“Huh,” I hear Giorgi absorb that piece of information.

“Davy…” Alex sounds as horrified as I feel.

“You were never supposed to know! None of you were ever supposed to know,” Davy shouts at him.

“Because you did something to keep me from realizing!” I accuse.

“No. Not me,” he says.

“But you know who did.”

“Yes.”

“Who?” I demand.

“Our mothers. Mine, yours, and Peter’s.”

“Yours for the power, mine for the shaping, and Peter’s for the forgetting,” I breathe out with a nod. It makes sense.

Davy nods. “You were never supposed to realize, but I think you’ve been undoing it since Ponchar.”

“All the power that took. *This* was why.” I bet it’s also why I’ve been waking up feeling like I’m forgetting something so often. *How many times did I realize it, only to forget again?* I wonder.

Davy nods a second time.

“So why didn’t you tell me then?”

“I was hoping it would hold.”

“Why?”

“Because seeing the future… that way lies madness, Hazel,” Davy sighs. “Giorgi was right when he said Alexandria is nervous all the time, but he was wrong about the reason why. From what I understand, seeing the future isn’t like looking out of a window and watching what’s happening on the street,” Davy asserts, watching me closely to see if I’ll disagree. “It’s hints and ideas, fleeting impressions and half-forgotten dreams. It’s hard to know what’s real and what’s not. It’s hard to tell which things are really glimpses of the future and which things your imagination has conjured because it was bored.

“Like the stones,” Davy interrogates. “You had no idea why they were important, just that they were, right?”

I nod. I had no idea why I was preoccupied with them for months.

“And holding your breath?”

“It seemed like it could be useful,” I answer in a small voice.

“*That’s* why you didn’t teach Liam. *That’s* why you got mad when I asked why you hadn’t,” Alex states.

“I thought about it, and every time I did, it seemed like a bad idea.”

“It makes you question every single thought,” Davy says. “It’s enough to drive a person mad.”

“The clothes and the comment about the goblin,” Liam says.

“The clothes were a guess,” I insist.

Liam doesn’t ask if I’m sure, but I can tell he wants to.

“If our positions were reversed, I would have left clothes for Alex.” I hope I sound more sure than I feel.

“See? Every. Single. Thought. *That’s* why I never told you. *That’s* why they did what they did. *That’s* why you were *never* supposed to find out.”

“I’m not her. I’ll figure out how to deal with it. I’ll be fine,” I assert with far more confidence than I actually possess.

“I can’t believe you would keep something like that from us,” Alex tells Davy.

“I couldn’t tell you, Alex,” he says, and I hear the pleading for understanding in his voice. “You would have told her.”

“Of course I would have told her! *You* should have told her!” Alex shouts back.

“You should have told me,” I agree.

“If the situation was reversed, would you have told me?” Davy questions.

“Yes,” we both answer in unison, without hesitation.

“We would have told you,” Alex bites out. “We would have told you because it’s important and we need to be able to trust each other! You don’t trust us at all.”

“I wouldn’t have left you to figure it out while you were alone, trapped wherever I was,” I tell him and I see the regret flash across his face.

“Even *I* think you should have told her, Davy,” Giorgi informs him, “and I keep practically everything to myself. I’m not going to tell Gavin,” he adds as he flicks his gaze to me.

“I can’t undo the past.”

“No,” Liam agrees, “but you can say sorry, Davy.”

Davy nods. “I’m sorry, Hazel.”

“I wouldn’t have done it to you,”I repeat.

“I know,” he admits softly.

----

Davy and Giorgi have left, and I’m sitting with my back against the wall around the edge of the rooftop with Alex on one side and Liam on the other. It feels like my entire world has split in two. Davy has always been the one person I’ve trusted most, and now I don’t know if I can trust him at all. It has me questioning my own judgement. I can deal with not being told *everything*, but *this* was something he should have told me, and we all know it. Even he knows it.

“You two told me once that Davy makes the hard decisions,” Liam begins carefully, like he knows he’s treading on dangerous ground with both of us. “I think this may have been one of them.”

“Really,” Alex scoffs, “you’re taking his side?”

“No, Alex. I think he should have told you too, but think about it. He was probably… what, five, when he started keeping that secret? Things like that, they’re not easy to let go of. I’m merely suggesting maybe you keep that in mind when you talk to him next.”

“*If* I talk to him next,” Alex mutters.

“Alex,” I chide.

“How would you feel if it was Liam, Hazel?”

“Betrayed. And I get it. It’s not the same, but I feel betrayed too. He loves you though. He loves both of us, even if we’re both really mad at him right now.”

“You should talk to him,” Liam states. “He’s not okay. He hasn’t been okay since the pass.”

“You think I don’t know that?” Alex snaps, his voice sounding raw. “I’ve been trying to get him to talk to me for months.”

“I can try, if you want?” I offer.

“Be my guest,” he tells me, sounding resigned.

“How much longer are we staying here?” I ask Liam.

“How much longer do you want to stay here?”

“Give me a day? We can go back the day after tomorrow.”

### 39 - Where is My Mind

“Were you able to find out anything about Reese?” I question Giorgi.

“Michael didn’t say so, but I very much got the impression that Reese is with Alexandria.”

I sigh, rubbing a hand over my face and pushing my hair back. If I’d only been more patient, more careful all of this could have been avoided. Gavin was right. I’m the one to blame for everything.

“Any idea whether she’s there by choice or not?”

“No.”

“Okay. Thanks for making sure Alex and I were there tonight.”

“Seemed like the sort of thing you should know about.”

I nod. “What’s your take on it?”

“As far as I can tell, Hazel seems perfectly sane. I think it’s like she said, less seeing the future and more… vague ideas that some things might be important,” Giorgi shrugs. “I can see how it could drive a person mad.”

So can I. That’s what worries me. I left Hazel and Alex on the rooftop to commiserate about Davy. I think they need some time alone, but I see both sides of the situation. Part of me thinks Hazel will be fine. However, an equally large part of me is terrified she won’t be. How does a person cope with something like that? With having to question and second guess every single thought? To evaluate if each one is an idle thought or a glimpse of the future? Maddening seems like it might be understating the situation.

If I’m being honest, I probably would have done exactly what Davy did, and never mentioned it. If I’m *really* being honest with myself, I don’t even think it’s a probably. More like a definitely. I definitely would have done what Davy did, even knowing she would feel betrayed if she ever found out.

“She’ll be fine,” Giorgi tells me, clearly seeing the direction my thoughts are headed. “She’s good at compartmentalizing.”

“I don’t know if you can compartmentalize something like that,” I mutter.

“She’ll be fine,” Giorgi reiterates, clapping a hand on my shoulder before walking away.

I wish I was half as sure as Giorgi seems to be.

----

I wake early the next morning to find Hazel sleeping, pressed up against me. Seeing her asleep gives me a small jolt of panic, but she looks so different right now than she did in the preceding days. Now, she actually looks like she’s sleeping, not like she’s dying, and it’s a welcome change.

She’s using my shoulder as a pillow, with an arm and a leg flung across me. Her long, dark hair is pooled around us both. I don’t get the chance to wake up like this often, since she normally sleeps so little. She usually goes to bed after me and frequently wakes up before me, leaving me wondering if she’s slept at all, so it’s not a regular occurrence that I get to enjoy waking up like this.

I’m hesitant to move, partially because I don’t want to wake her, but mostly because I would stay here like this forever if I could. Unfortunately, I have things I need to do, so I force myself to get out of bed anyway. It’s a process and it takes me a couple of minutes to slowly slide out from beneath Hazel without waking her.

When I finally make it to my feet, I see Alex standing in the doorway, trying to suppress a fit of laughter. I sigh. We definitely need to get out of here. We’ve been living on top of each other for days now, and everyone is getting sick of it.

“What are you doing up?” I ask as I make it to the doorway and push him through it before he can get it in his head that it’s a good idea to wake Hazel.

“Didn’t sleep much,” he says with a shrug.

“Because of Davy?”

He shrugs again, which I take as a yes.

“You could have just gotten up, you know. She would have fallen back asleep.”

“No one asked you.”

“So touchy. So sentimental,” Alex mocks.

“And you’re not?” I pry.

He snorts. “No. Neither is she. None of us are. Of the three of us, Davy’s likely the most sentimental, and that’s not saying much.”

“Hmm.”

“So what are you up to this morning?”

“Looking for a way out already?” I inquire.

“Maybe,” he admits quietly.

“Have you two talked at all since last night?”

“No.”

“And now you’re avoiding him?”

“No one asked *you*,” he tells me, clearly not wanting to discuss it. At least not with me.

“Fine. I’m going to see your mother. Want to come?” I ask. Having Alex along could be useful. He knows Alexandria a lot better than me.

“Do you actually want me to come?”

I shrug. “You could be useful, and it doesn’t look like you’re doing anything better.”

“Well, since you make such a compelling argument, I guess I shall avail myself to you,” he responds sarcastically.

“Are you going to be a pain in the ass all day?”

“Probably. It’s a lot more fun for me that way.”

“Great,” I mutter. “Well. As long as you’re having fun.”

“That’s my motto too,” he states, and I can’t tell if he’s serious or not.

----

The houses get steadily larger as we get closer to the manse where Alexandria has been staying since she arrived in Branton. I grew up in a decently well appointed house in the city due to my grandfather’s former position within the Army of the Allied Polities, but nothing like this.

“Was every house you lived in like this?” I ask Alex.

“Like what?”

“Obscenely large,” Giorgi supplies.

Giorgi and Gavin grew up in a much more modest part of Branton, but spent a lot of time with my grandparents and me as kids, since their own parents worked such long hours running a market stall. Everyone thought it was the best way to keep the two of them out of trouble. I’m fairly confident no one expected that I’d end up ensuring Giorgi and Gavin were neck deep in all of this.

“For the most part,” Alex supplies. “It’s camouflage.”

“In what sense?” I probe.

Alex shrugs. “All of them. You’ve met her. Money, or the illusion of such, makes people overlook and forgive a lot.”

“Where does she get the money for these places? If she’s been hiding for years, how is she funding this?” Giorgi asks.

I wait to see what Alex says.

“No idea. I assume she’s not. She doesn’t need to. I assume she’s just taking what she wants.”

“Huh,” I mumble.

“Huh, what?” Alex queries.

“You don’t know.”

“*What* don’t I know?” he questions sharply.

“She’s not just taking them. It seems as though most of these properties are owned by your family, and have been for years. It’s what I was trying to tell you all I found out before we left Branton.” I see Alex has no idea what I’m talking about. “I found property records all over, recording properties owned by either an A Raidane or a W Raidane. All of the records are for very large properties, which have been owned for a minimum of ten years as far as I can tell. I found records in every polity, Branton and Corriven.”

“Interesting,” Alex remarks, digesting that information. “Still doesn’t mean she didn’t just take them though.”

“How do you figure?”

“Ultimately property records are simply paperwork. I think Hazel already demonstrated how easy it is to make the paperwork say what you need it to say.”

Giorgi laughs.

“Did you ever check who currently owns the manor your parents were living in when she killed them?” Alex asks me, as if he’s inquiring about what’s for lunch, even though one of those people was his father.

“No.”

“Well, if you like looking at paperwork, I imagine that might be of interest.”

If what he’s suggesting is true, the implications are staggering. Horrifying even.

“It’s the sort of thing she would find… practical,” he finishes with a flat affectation. “And here we are,” he says, approaching a short staircase in front of a brick house, and gesturing to the door as he steps aside.

I knock on the door and wait. After a few minutes, Anna, the same woman from Leisch, opens the door. She looks as disinterested as ever when she invites us in and leads us to a sitting room.

Giorgi and I sit down to wait, but Alex moves around the room restlessly picking up items, inspecting them, and setting them back down. I’m not sure if it’s nerves or boredom, but I keep an eye on him as he rifles through the items on the bookshelves. Finally, he pockets something from the shelf, rearranges a few of the knickknacks, and brings a bronze statue over to the table in front of where Giorgi and I are sitting before perching on the arm of the sofa, with his arms folded across his chest.

We wait for several minutes, and as we do I can feel Alex doing something. I’m just not sure what. I’m watching him in my peripheral vision, but he’s not paying any attention to us. Whatever he’s doing, his attention is focused entirely on it, and the air almost feels like it’s crackling with the power swirling around in it, but it doesn’t seem like Giorgi has noticed at all.

Finally, Alexandria comes into the room, followed closely by Reese. Alexandria looks as icy and distant as ever. Reese looks… fine?

“Hi, mom,” Alex greets.

“Alexander, how nice to see you. I thought you might visit sooner.”

“I’ve been busy. Davy tells me you can see the future. You *and* Hazel, as it turns out.”

“Ah. So you all finally know, now.”

“We know,” Alex tells her. “I have to say, I was surprised. I think Hazel will handle it a lot better than you, though.”

“Perhaps.”

“So is that what made you the way you are?”

“It probably didn’t help,” she says, shrugging.

“Reese, why are you here?” I ask.

“Reese belongs to me,” Alexandria asserts, before Reese has a chance to speak.

“Meaning what?” I question, meeting Alexandria’s eyes.

Her eyes are so similar to Hazel’s, just a slightly brighter shade of blue, and yet it couldn’t be any more clear that the person looking out of them is completely different.

“I claimed her as mine long ago. The same way Hazel claimed you all as hers back in Leisch.”

“And what, exactly, does that mean, mother?”

“It means I’m responsible for her life. If something were to happen to her, something within my power to prevent, it would cost me.”

“Cost you?” I inquire, hoping for more information.

“I once made a promise—a claim on someone—that I was unable to… fulfill. And, as we all know, actions have consequences.”

“Consequences such as…?” Alex questions.

“That assertion, when made by someone such as myself or your sister, isn’t merely idle words, Alexander. The words have weight, they bind you to others. It’s a geas of a sort, and failing steals a piece of your humanity. So if you want to know why I am the way I am…” she trails off as she tips her head slightly to the side.

“That doesn’t explain Lisette,” Giorgi states.

“The blond?” Alexandria asks. “Did Hazel kill her, then?”

“Yes,” I answer. “And she’s the same as ever.”

“You misunderstand. A claim on someone isn’t a promise to keep them alive. Thinking that would be a mistake. It’s more like… a vow to keep them safe. Sometimes the best way to keep someone safe is to kill them.”

Alex bursts out laughing. “You really, truly mean that.”

“Of course I do.”

“Who else have you claimed?” I interrogate.

“Not you.”

“So why is Reese here?”

“So I can fulfill my duty to her.”

“According to Alexandria, if I didn’t come with her, Iverson would have killed me,” Reese informs me, finally speaking for the first time.

“And you believed her,” Alex states.

“Yes,” Reese replies simply.

“Are you okay, Reese?” I want to know.

She looks well enough physically, but I can tell she’s on edge. She practically raised me. Whatever she’s doing here, it wasn’t her idea. I know that much.

“I would prefer not to be here, but I also enjoy being alive,” Reese tells me, succinctly.

“I’m sorry.”

“This isn’t your fault, Liam. This is a prison of my own making.”

“Did you know when we were at your shop?” I find myself asking her.

“Yes. I’m sorry Liam. Please apologize to Peter and Hazel for me. I should have told you all the truth. I just… couldn’t.”

“Why not?

Reese looks pointedly at Alexandria.

“Did you know what your sister did to mine?” Alex questions Reese.

“Yes. Whether you believe it or not, it was for the best.”

“Hmm,” is Alex’s only response.

“Is Reese free to leave, Alexandria?”

“No.”

“It’s fine, Liam,” Reese states before I can respond. “I’m fine. You all should go,” she glances at Alexandria again.

“Yes, you should. This conversation bores me. I am unclear what my daughter sees in you,” she mutters.

I resist the urge to laugh at that statement, but only because I know that doing so has the potential to result in both my death and Hazel’s. I’m pretty sure Hazel would have laughed at her, though.

“Why are you still here in Branton, mom? Why haven’t you gone to Corriven yet? Wasn’t that the big plan? Go to Corriven and then back to Avonare? So why are you still here?”

“I’m waiting for your sister.”

“Hazel? Why?”

“You should all be going now,” Alexandria says, standing abruptly. “Anna, show them out.”

“What were you doing in there?” I ask Alex once we’re back out on the street.

“What?” Alex replies distractedly.

“In there. The magic. What were you doing?”

“Making sure my mother wasn’t lying to us.”

“You can do that?” I’m surprised.

“I can do a lot of things,” he remarks off-handedly.

“What did you take?”

“Nothing,” he answers without breaking his stride. He’s at least as good of a liar as Hazel is. Possibly better.

He definitely took something from the shelves, and he doesn’t want to share what it was. I’m intrigued. I glance at Giorgi, but he simply shrugs. He doesn’t know what it was either.

### 40 - Steal My Sunshine

“Hey Peter, do you have a few minutes? Can we talk?” I ask.

“Sure.”

“Let’s go for a walk. I’m dying to get out of this flat.”

It’s true, but mostly I’m dying not to have this conversation in front of an audience. Liam left earlier this morning with Giorgi and Alex, but everyone else is still hanging around. I can tell Amelia desperately wants to invite herself along, but she sees me glaring at her, so she doesn’t.

Last night, I spent some time digging through everything Alex pulled me out of the river with, looking for Peter’s now somewhat deformed journal. It’s legible but the pages have gone all wavy from being waterlogged and then drying out.

“Why are you and I out for a walk together, Hazel?” Peter asks after we’ve been walking down the street for several minutes and covered maybe a quarter of a mile.

“I figured I should apologize and return this,” I answer, deciding not to beat around the bush, as I hand over his journal.

Peter stares at it for a long second, before reaching over to take it, his face expressionless. “You were in my house?” he questions, finally.

“Yes. Amelia took me there when the three of you disappeared, and I took that.”

“Because you didn’t trust me.”

“Yes and no. I never thought you’d betray Liam, but I did consider the possibility you might use him somehow to betray me.”

“And you read it.” He phrases it such that I know it’s definitely a statement and not a question.

“Yes. You would have done the same if our situations were reversed.”

He nods begrudgingly.

“For what it’s worth. I *am* sorry. Not about taking it, or reading it. That was just smart. But I’m sorry about what Liam said to you,” I inform him, and I mean it. “I would have never asked him to tell you that, and I wouldn’t pick me in that scenario,” I add softly.

“I imagine that’s part of why Liam will always choose you.”

“He shouldn’t. No one should ‘always’ choose anyone. Anyway. I’m sorry.”

We walk along in silence for a few minutes, before I decide to start meddling.

“Your flat is very nice. Quite cozy,” I comment.

“Thanks?” he replies uncertainly.

“You’re welcome. So how are things with you and Amelia? She says you’re not back together.”

“We’re not.”

“Why not?”

“All the same reasons as before,” he tells me.

“All the same reasons as before don’t *really* apply, Peter. I think she’s more or less aware of all the secrets you were keeping, which was what she had a problem with. That problem is basically solved now.”

He says nothing.

“I’m merely saying I’m pretty sure she’s open to the idea. I’m practically her best friend,” I state. I have no idea if it’s true, but I think it might be. “I would know.”

He snorts.

“What?”

“*You* are practically her best friend?” he challenges, disbelievingly.

“I am! At least in Branton. Ask her.”

“I will,” he replies as we continue walking.

It feels like Peter and I might have finally made some progress toward fixing things.

----

When Peter and I finally return, I see Davy on the balcony—in the same position he was in when we left—moping. I’m still really, really mad at him. But part of me also knows Liam is right, and I did mean it last night when I told Alex that I’m *sure* Davy loves both of us. I’m sure of it in the way I am sure of very few things. I’m sure of it in the same way I’m sure gravity exists and the sun will rise in the east.

I set my hurt feelings aside and go out on the balcony.

“So are you just going to hide out here forever?” I ask him.

“I’m not hiding.”

“Yes you are. I get it. I’d hide too.”

“I’m not hiding.”

“If I was not hiding in the same way that you’re not hiding, would you say I was hiding, or…?” I retort, throwing a variant of the words he’s said to me so many times back at him.

“Piss off, Hazel.”

“Make me.”

He sighs in irritation. It’s better than sadness. I count it as a win.

“Great. Now that we’ve established that you both can’t and won’t try to make me, I want to *do* something.”

He sighs again. “What?”

“Those butter tarts you always had, can we go get some?”

He knows I actually like them, and it plays to everyone’s desire—including my own—to feed me.

“Fine.”

Another win. Score: Hazel two, Davy zero.

----

“So where are we going?” I inquire, looping my arm through his as we walk.

“A bakery on Church street.”

“How long since you were last there?”

“A couple of weeks before we left to go to Firgasu.”

“Hmm. Did you bring Alex there?”

“Yes.”

“Interesting.”

“What?” Davy asks.

“Well, you never brought *me* there.”

“Yes. Because I take you to so many bakeries,” Davy comments sarcastically.

“That’s exactly my point!”

Davy sighs. “What do you want, Hazel?”

“A butter tart. Perhaps several butter tarts. Haven’t you been paying attention?”

“Hazel, what do you *want*?”

“I want to know what’s up with you. Alex is worried. Liam is worried. I am… not unworried.”

“I’m fine,” he tells me.

“Yeah. Me too.”

He gives me a sideways look, but says nothing.

“And since we’re both so fine, I figure we’ll get a bunch of butter tarts, and sit in the park and eat them, while we contemplate our mutual fineness.”

“So I take it you’re not fine either,” he says softly.

“I’ve been better,” I admit. “But I’ve been worse too,” I finish with a shrug. “You?”

“I’ve definitely been better.”

“Well, once we are appropriately fortified with small tarts you can tell me all about it. Because I *am* interested.”

----

Davy and I are lying on a blanket I bought after we got the butter tarts, because nothing ruins a good lie about in the park like being stabbed by a thousand tiny blades of grass.

“So what’s up?” I ask after I’ve crammed the second tart into my mouth.

“Everything. Nothing.”

“Yeah,” I nod. “I know all about everything and nothing. We’re like this,” I tell him as I cross my fingers. “It’s always the worst when it’s everything and nothing.”

“Yeah,” he agrees softly. “Out of everyone, I think you actually do know.”

“I do.” I offer no glib comments because I have none. I do know, and it sucks.

“Alex doesn’t get it,” Davy states.

“He wouldn’t. I don’t think Liam does either. He doesn’t get it in a totally different way than Alex but… I don’t know. They’re lucky like that, I guess.”

We stare at the clouds in silence for a while.

“It hasn’t been this bad since…” Davy begins before trailing off.

“Since the last time Christine up and vanished?”

“Probably. You’d think I wouldn’t care by this point.”

I shrug. “She’s a mindfuck. Even *I* think so, and it’s nowhere near the same thing for me as it is for you. Another thing I know isn’t the same, but I’m going to say it anyway: there are a lot of other people who love you.”

“I know that intellectually, but sometimes it’s hard to feel it,” he tells me. “I just… I wish I didn’t care. You don’t care.”

“No, but I’m… me. Caring is normal, even if it sucks. It bothers me sometimes that I *don’t* care,” I admit. “*Everyone* else cares, and I can’t even pretend to care. It’s just another way that I’m not like everyone else.”

“I guess the grass is always greener.”

“Pretty much.” I agree, as I eat another tart. “Everything and nothing. You know it’s part of the reason why I’m always doing so many objectively stupid, dangerous things? It’s not that I don’t know they’re stupid and dangerous, I just… don’t care. Sometimes I try to, but I can’t.”

“I know.”

“Only now I’ve got to care, or at least try to remember to pretend to care because of Liam.”

“I know. I’m sorry.”

“It feels inevitable that I’m going to fuck it all up,” I admit.

“Have you told Liam that?”

“No. I think he’s already freaked out enough about… me,” I reply, as I gesture at myself.

“You’ll be fine,” Davy says.

“The way we’re always fine?” I ask.

“Probably. You should talk to Liam.”

“And you should talk to Alex. Even if he doesn’t get it.”

“I think I’m going to go back to my flat,” Davy tells me after several minutes of silence.

I nod. “It doesn’t seem like there’s much reason not to. He knows we’re both here and if he wants to find us, it’s not going to matter where we’re hiding,” I comment softly. “He’ll find a way in,” I say, thinking of the Ginnelstreet flat I so recently turned into ashes. “Plus, I miss your flat.”

“That’s how I see it too. It’s simply a matter of time.”

“Unless we can do something about him,” I state with a sigh. “I told Commander Selby he should have assassinated Iverson, rather than removing him from his position.”

“What was his response to that?” Davy inquires curiously.

“Something like, ‘we can’t go around assassinating polity leaders,’’’ I respond, imitating his tone.

“And what did you say?”

“If you’re worried I told him I was pretty sure we could, I didn’t. But I’m pretty sure we can. I just don’t know if we can kill that *specific* polity leader.”

“You think he’s more powerful than you?”

“Maybe. I don’t know and I’m not sure there’s a good way to find out without dying in the process.”

“Hmm,” he murmurs.

“You know what the really awful part is?”

“You’ve got to die sometime?”

I nod. “You’ve got to die sometime, so why not fuck around and find out?”

“Liam?”

“Liam,” I concur. “Being responsible for another person’s life is a terrible thing.”

“I don’t know. I hear it has some nice perks,” Davy remarks.

“You have heard nothing of the sort,” I say confidently. “You’re just fishing.”

### 41 - Sucker

“I’m sorry about the flat,” I apologize to Liam, as we stand together on the balcony in the twilight of the evening. “For burning it down,” I supply. I figure someone must have told him about it at some point over the last few days.

Liam shrugs. “It was nice while it lasted.”

“Do you know what he was looking for? There was definitely something there he was expecting to find, and whatever it was, he didn’t get it.”

“No. I have no clue. There was nothing in the flat worth the trouble, as far as I know. We were drugged and tied up in a cellar the entire time, so if he ever said what he was looking for, none of us heard it.”

“How *did* he manage to capture all three of you?” I interrogate.

One person I can see—magic or no magic, if someone gets the drop on you, good luck. You can only be prepared for what you know, or can reasonably expect, is coming. Magic doesn’t stop you from being surprised or stop someone from bashing you over the head if you have no idea they’re there. But three people? I’m not sure how that happens without some bloodshed, at the very least.

“You know the festival smoke bombs? The ones that make the colored smoke at the performances around the holidays?

“Yes,” I answer. “I’ve always quite liked them.”

“I think he managed to drug the smoke somehow. We went into Reese’s shop, and I heard a hissing sound, saw smoke, and then woke up in a cellar.”

“Hmm,” I think.

Malusium is heavy. It’s more like sugar crystals, not powdery like flour, or anything else you might be able to throw into the air and have hang there suspended by the air currents for a bit. Usually, if you want to drug someone with it, you mix it into something they’re going to ingest. Since it’s tasteless, that’s typically the simplest, most direct way to get it into their bloodstream. But I suppose if you wanted to, you could dissolve it into water, soak something in the solution, and let the water evaporate leaving the malusium behind. Then if you burned it, that might, in theory, allow it to get into your system via inhalation. But it’s equally possible the flames would render it inert. I don’t know. I’ve never tried it, or had it tried on me. I think it could work though. If so, it’s pretty clever. Then mix that with ether or something similar, and you get something that’s capable of rendering a person both unconscious and devoid of any magic they might posses.

“What?” Liam queries, wanting to know what I’m thinking.

“I mean, it’s clever. Cleverer than I would have given him credit for, based on our interactions so far,” I explain as I look out over the street.

“You sound like you’re disappointed you didn’t come up with the idea,” Liam tells me.

I shrug, not disagreeing.

“*Are* you?”

“Maybe a bit? It’s clever. I always appreciate clever. I especially always appreciate *being* the clever one.”

Liam snorts, and I can’t tell if it’s in amusement or disbelief.

“You have a source for malusium, right? You were using it back at the flat. Can you get me some? And by ‘some’ I mean a lot.”

“What are you going to do with it?” he inquires suspiciously.

“Experiment.”

“I already don’t like the sound of that.”

“Could be useful.”

“I’ll see what I can do,” he agrees with a sigh.

“Thanks,” I murmur, leaning further over the railing, trying to decide if I want to broach the next topic of conversation, and the answer is that I really, really don’t. Part of me thinks Liam probably has a right to know, but a bigger part of me would prefer to never discuss it. To lock away all of the bits of myself I don’t like, pretend they don’t exist, and never talk about them. Only now his life is my life, and I’m unsure what that entitles him to know. Davy thinks I should tell him, but he’s one to talk. I sigh.

“What?” Liam probes when I’m quiet for a few minutes.

“Hmm?”

“I recognize that look on your face, Hazel.”

“What look?”

“That look of discontent that says you’re trying to decide if you should tell me something or not,” he responds. “And the answer is yes. You should tell me.”

“You like knowing everything. That doesn’t mean I like sharing everything,” I comment tersely.

“I know,” he states before falling silent. Waiting.

“I hate when you do that. When you stand there and wait like it’s inevitable I’m going to tell you. It’s not.”

“I know.”

“I hate this magical connection between us!” I burst out, and I see the look of hurt that flashes across his face before he’s able to cover it up with a disinterested mask. “No, it’s not like that,” I reach out for his hand. He doesn’t offer his back, but he also doesn’t pull away when I take it anyway. “That came out wrong. I love you, but I hate this. I hate that if I die, you die. I can’t… it’s a lot of responsibility I never wanted, and I’m pretty sure I’m going to screw up eventually, and get you killed. It seems inevitable. I don’t want you to die because I’m careless or unlucky,” I explain softly.

“I feel like anything I can say to that is going to make you angry.”

“Try me,” I tell him.

Liam sighs. “Okay, but hear me out first, and promise me you won’t walk away in the middle of the conversation.”

“Alright,” I agree.

“Let me begin by saying that you’re complicated in ways I can’t even begin to understand, so when I ask you this I’m not being facetious, and I’m not trying to be reductive,” he states, pausing to wait for my acknowledgment.

“Okay.”

“Have you considered not taking so many risks and generally being more careful?”

I tamp down on the frustration I feel beginning to push its way to the forefront of my mind. I take a breath. Hold it. Then let it go, as I endeavor to remind myself he’s trying.

“I can’t,” I answer, in what I hope is a neutral tone, as I avoid meeting his eyes. “You were both right and wrong when you called me an adrenaline junkie—or maybe right, but with an incomplete understanding. I am, but it’s more complex than that. I can’t just be more careful, because that involves both caring and *remembering* that I care. And a lot of times I don’t. I don’t care about my life. Davy once told me I don’t have a death wish, but I also don’t *not* have a death wish, and that’s true. Before you get the wrong idea,” I continue, holding up a hand to stop him from interrupting, “I’m *not* suicidal. But that might just be because that would involve a level of interest in my own life that I frankly don’t have.

“I care about *you* a lot, but if I’m being fully honest, I’m bound to get so bored, or so angry that I forget.” I take a deep breath, and force myself to keep going. “That I forget our lives are linked and that my death will cause yours, or… Or that I forget I care about you, and I’ll kill us both.

“I try caring. I try *really* hard, but I’m honestly terrible at it. I’m going to get you killed.”

Liam leans against the railing, saying nothing for a few moments. I’m not sure if he’s waiting to make sure I’m done, or if he’s gathering his own thoughts, so I try to be patient.

Finally, he simply says, “I’m okay with that, Hazel.”

“That’s it? You’re ‘okay’ with it?”

“Yes. I *like* being connected to you.”  He releases my hand, letting his fingers trail along it as he does, before walking back inside.

I stand on the balcony alone, unsure what to make of any of that until Alex eventually comes out.

“What was all that about?”

I shake my head, too confused to answer.

“I went and talked to mom today,” he informs me.

“Is that where you guys were?”

“Liam didn’t tell you?”

I shrug. “I didn’t ask. I went and talked to Davy today.”

“Bet my conversation was more interesting,” Alex responds, clearly still angry with Davy.

“Probably. So go on and tell me what she said, then.”

“She said that in Leisch, when she asked you if you were claiming us all as yours, and you said yes, that wasn’t idle chit chat.”

I nod. I got as much at the time, even if I don’t know what I was actually agreeing to.

“Do you know what that means?” he asks me.

“No, but I know it means something. I knew it then. I could feel it.”

“Huh. I was halfway wondering if she was losing it,” he mutters.

“So what does it mean, since she seems to have told you?”

“She said it was some sort of geas.”

“A geas? Those aren’t real.”

“Yeah, neither are prognosticators,” Alex states wryly.

I sigh. “Fine. A  geas for what?”

“That’s where it gets… weird.”

“Because it isn’t *all* already weird?”

“Weirder, then. According to her, it’s like a vow of safekeeping or something. She tried to say that there are consequences to failing it. The kind of consequences which eat away at your humanity.”

“Great. Because I have so much of that already,” I mutter. “What about Lisette, then? I didn’t exactly keep her safe.”

“Funny. That was Giorgi’s first question, too.”

I shrug and wait for Alex to answer.

“Apparently, sometimes the best way to keep someone safe is to kill them.”

I can’t help but burst out laughing at the absurdity of it.

“Funny,” Alex remarks again, grinning. “*That* was my reaction. I picked up a present for you while I was there.” He hands me a small pouch.

I open it. “Malusium. I was just asking for some of this.”

“Not *just* malusium. *Mom’s* malusium. The good stuff. You know she grows and refines it herself?”

“I did not. I guess that explains how she always has a ready supply of it.”

“Hers is more potent than what Iverson had.”

“Really?”

“Really.”

### 42 - I Put a Spell on You

“Where were you?” Commander Selby asks. “And why was Hazel Raidane in my office suggesting assassinating General Iverson would have been more appropriate than removing him from his position?”

I wince before I have the good sense to mask the reaction.

“Yes,” he says, seeing it. “She did, Captain Marten.”

“I had not been made aware of that particular conversation, Commander. But to answer your first question, General Iverson ambushed me while I was out collecting information about his current actions. When I woke up, I was locked in a basement cellar of the Dairuvar compound.”

I have Commander Selby’s full attention now. “When did this occur?”

“Perhaps a couple of hours after the vote to remove him.”

“And Miss Raidane figured he was behind your absence.”

There was no question there, so I offer no response.

He pinches the bridge of his nose, rubbing at it like he has a headache. “Who is she, Liam?”

“Alexandria Raidane’s daughter.”

“*Who* is she? Do us both a favor. Don’t make me repeat the question again.”

I say nothing as I weigh my options. Hazel won’t like it, but I don’t see a good alternative. If he’s asking, he already has suspicions. Lying to him about those suspicions won’t do anyone any good.

“She is also General Iverson’s daughter,” I inform him, neutrally.

“Fucking hell. How long have you known?”

I sigh. “I’ve known she’s Alexandria Raidane’s child for a while,” I admit. “Well before we left for Firgasu. I didn’t find out who her father is until more recently.”

“More recently, when?”

“When we were crossing the pass into Firgasu, sir,” I answer, staring past his shoulder, not quite meeting his gaze.

“Please tell me exactly what it is I’m paying you for, Captain Marten.”

“It wasn’t actionable information, sir,” I try, knowing it’s a weak excuse. A *very* weak excuse.

“According to John, the two of you spend quite a bit of time together.”

Gods damned John Steeple. I resist the urge to tell Commander Selby that some people, including him, need to learn to mind their own business, and say nothing instead.

“No comment to that, then?”

“No, sir.”

“So Iverson ambushed you, locked you in a basement, and now you’re back here? Fill in the rest of the story, if you will.”

“She realized he was likely behind my absence, and extended an invitation for a trade to occur at the Northend Bluffs to get me back.”

“A trade for…?”

“She didn’t specify, sir. She was under the impression he was looking for something. I got the same impression. Neither of us knows what, though. So she stated she would trade to get me back. He evidently thought she either had what he was looking for, or knew where to acquire it, and was willing to exchange me for it. She obviously didn’t have it, so when General Iverson arrived with me, we jumped off the cliff into the river.”

“You jumped off the cliff,” he mutters, his hand rubbing at the bridge of his nose again.

“Yes.”

“And this necessitated your absence for over a week?”

“Hazel was injured.”

“And you didn’t bring her back here… because?”

I have no good response. I can’t say she was too injured to move because if that was true, there would still be evidence of that injury, and there’s not. Finally, I settle on, “It did not seem prudent.”

“Damnit, Liam,” he mutters. “You’re not making this easy. You know your grandfather and I are close, yes?”

I nod. My grandfather has always thought of Commander Selby as the son he never had, and after my mother left, that became more apparent, as I understand it.

“Are you aware I knew your mother?”

“I had always assumed you were at least acquainted with one another, given your familiarity with my grandfather.”

“Yes,” he drums his fingers across the table. “I was also acquainted with your father and Alexandria Raidane.”

“Ah.”

“Indeed,” he states, nodding. “So would you like to try explaining the past week to me again? In detail this time.”

I walk him through the past week, obfuscating fewer of the details this time, although I do omit the fact there was anyone else present aside from Hazel, Amelia, Henry, and me. Commander Selby knows little about the others, and I see no good reason to change that.

“Do you know what happened that left her unconscious for five days?”

“No.

“Does *she*?”

“If she does, she hasn’t said, though I get the impression she does not.”

“For someone so deeply involved with her, you seem to know very little,” he comments harshly.

“Was there a question in that sentiment, sir?” I bristle.

“Merely an observation. I would tread carefully, if I was you, Liam. The Raidanes are dangerous, and the Raidane women especially so.”

I resist the urge to scoff. We are so far beyond that.

“Is there anything else?” I ask.

“Do you know where Iverson is now?” he inquires.

“No. I’ve heard nothing of his whereabouts, but I would very much like to know where he is.”

“Yes, I imagine so. Nevertheless, Captain Marten, you will leave General Iverson alone, and you will not go digging for information about him. Am I clear?”

I nod.

“I offer you quite a bit of liberty in your day to day activities, Captain Marten,” Commander Selby begins.

“Yes, sir,” I agree.

“I permit it because it has proven useful to me in the past, Liam. Do not give me reason to regret that, or you will quickly find it to no longer be the case. Do you understand?”

“Yes, sir,” I repeat.

“Very well. You may go.”

----

I return to my room, shutting the door with slightly more force than is strictly necessary.

“I take it things could have gone better, then?” Hazel asks, from where she’s currently sitting cross-legged on the floor holding a sewing needle and some thread.

I give a curt nod. “Excuse me for a moment,” I tell her, as I make the split second decision to reopen the door and step back into the hallway.

I knock on John’s door. He doesn’t answer, but I’m pretty sure he’s in there, so I bang harder until I finally see the knob begin to twist. Then I stop and wait for the door to open.

John looks momentarily taken aback to see me standing in front of his door. We’re not friends. Until this point, we’ve been polite acquaintances, occasionally nodding hello to one another in passing. We don’t work together, and we have little reason to speak to one another. There’s also always been something about him that has rubbed me the wrong way. He’s a little too eager to kiss everyone’s ass.

“Liam,” he greets uncertainly.

“John. I hear you’ve been discussing my personal relationships with Commander Selby.”

I stand mute and wait for him to fill the silence, as Hazel so often accuses me of doing to her. Saying nothing, while staring directly at someone, making it clear you’re both waiting for and expecting a response, is a very useful technique. Just ask my grandmother.

“I—he *asked* Liam. Specifically asked. What was I supposed to say?”

“Perhaps that you don’t make a habit of prying into others’ personal affairs,” I suggest.

“But—”

“No, John. No buts. If he asks again, you will tell him you haven’t seen or noticed anything out of the ordinary, and you will not detail any aspect of my personal relationships to him.” It’s not a suggestion.

“Yes. Of course.”

I notice his gaze has gone slightly unfocused.

“Good. That’s all.”

He nods, and retreats back into his room, shutting the door.

I step back into mine.

“Did you just…?” Hazel asks.

“Yes. He was telling Commander Selby about us.”

“Obviously,” she responds.

“Yes. Well. My personal relationships are none of their business.”

“So you decided to make sure of it,” she comments, grinning. “I think I like this side of you. It’s very…” she trails off, her eyes roaming over my body.

“Very…?” I ask.

“I like it,” she informs me, her voice taking on a huskier quality as she stands and approaches me.

She places her hands on my sides as she steps in close, running them up and over my chest before sliding them around the back of my neck and into my hair as she brings my face toward hers, kissing me deeply. I can’t help but instantly respond, and somehow she tastes of coffee and cinnamon. I let myself enjoy the feeling of our mouths on each other for a few moments before I pull away slightly.

“We should talk,” I tell her.

“Later,” Hazel demands, moving back toward me.

“You’re not going to like what we should talk about.”

“Then definitely later,” she replies before kissing me again.

----

“What did you want to talk about?” she asks when we’re lying tangled on the bed together.

I sigh. “Commander Selby knows about you.”

“About me…?” she questions warily.

“He knows General Iverson is your father,” I explain, and I feel her tense slightly. I knew she wouldn’t like it. I should have insisted we talk immediately when I came back instead of delaying the inevitable.

“You told him?”

“Yes. I didn’t have much choice.” I run my fingers along her skin, hoping to keep her here with me, even though I know it’s unlikely. “I told you that you wouldn’t like it. He also knows about your magic.”

She pulls away now, sitting up and putting distance between us on the bed.

“You *told* him?”

“He heavily implied he already knew, or at least suspected as much. So yes. I told him. Apparently, he has more than a passing familiarity with your mother.”

“Of course he does,” she mutters irritatedly, as she gets off the bed and starts pulling on her clothes.

“Where are you going?”

“To see if I can find Amelia,” she bites out.

“Amelia?” I wonder.

“Yes!” she snaps back at me. “We’re friends! Why is everyone so surprised by that?”

“Everyone?”

“Fine. Not everyone. Just you and Peter.”

“Me and Peter,” I echo back again.

“Yes! Peter and I talked too. I know what you told him. And *not* because he told me, because unlike some people, he seems to know how to keep his mouth shut,” she supplies, angrily.

“You’re defending Peter now?” I ask, confused.

“Apparently!”

“Okay. Do you want to talk about it?”

“No. Yes. I don’t know. Maybe, but not right now,” she finishes before walking out the door.

### 43 - Cassandra

I can’t believe Liam! He could have lied. He could have doubled down and insisted he didn’t know anything. That’s what I would have done if the situation was reversed. Playing dumb is a viable fucking strategy. Why is that so hard for people to understand? All you have to do is ask, ‘What do you mean?’ while being sure to sound appropriately confused. It’s *not* hard. And if they insist they’re sure you know something, you tell them a completely asinine story. You tell them that you gods damned like oolong tea!

I have half a mind to barge into Commander Selby’s office and tell him if he has questions about me, he can ask them *to* me. But even as enraged as I am, I know that would be stupid. So instead I stalk down the hallway away from Liam’s room, toward Amelia’s, like I said I was going to.

I bang my fist against her door when I get to her room. I really hope she’s in.

It’s only a second before she answers the door.

“Want to spar with me?” I ask.

“You seem like you’re in a great mood,” she comments drily.

“I don’t want to talk about it.”

“Okay. Sure. Why not.”

I nod. “Thanks.”

We walk to the gym together at a slightly more sedate pace than I used while getting to her room.

“What do you suppose is going to happen?” she asks as we walk.

“With what?”

“The polities. The alliance.”

“Oh. That. Nothing good.”

“Nothing good like…?”

“I don’t know,” I shrug. “Probably Dairuvar will invent some reason to make incursions on Avonare or Leira. I imagine Oulanen will either remain neutral or join Dairuvar. My money is on the latter. Then Avonare and Firgasu will join together against them. Leira polity may join Avonare and Firgasu, or it may stay neutral. My money is, again, on the latter unless Dairuvar chooses to move against Leira, which is probably why they’ll choose Avonare. I don’t know what that will mean for Branton, Corriven, or the Army of the Allied Polities though. I’m not great with all that… treaty stuff. You probably know more about it than I do.”

“So you think there will be a civil war?”

“Yes. Don’t you?”

She nods reluctantly. “You can’t do anything to stop it?” Amelia wonders.

“Like what?” I inquire. “I’m not *that* powerful, Amelia. No one is.”

“What about everyone working together?”

I try not to let my expression change. “What do you mean?” I probe, carefully.

“It’s just… if a bunch of us combined our magic, maybe we could have more of an impact than one person alone.”

I sigh. “It’s not a bad thought, but… there are tens of thousands of people who are going to be directly involved in this. You’re not talking about influencing the decisions or actions of a single person. It would have to be everyone, all at the same time, or it would be too… tenuous, and that’s a lot. I don’t think it’s doable,” I inform her softly. “At least, I don’t think I could do it.”

“So you think someone else could?” she questions, and I can see a flicker of hope in her expression.

“No. Sorry. I really don’t think it’s possible,” I answer as we reach the gym.

“Best of three?”

“Okay,” I nod.

“Are you sure you’re up for this? I’m not going to break you, am I?”

“No. You’re not going to break me,” I sigh in irritation.

“Hey, can you blame me for asking? You must have looked in a mirror at some point in the past few days.”

“Yes. No. It’s fine. I’m working on it.”

“Good,” Amelia nods. “Let’s go.”

I win the first, but lose the second. And for the first time, it’s not because I was distracted or because I let Amelia win.

“You’re slow,” Amelia comments.

“I know.”

“And being even skinnier isn’t doing you any favors.”

“*I know.*”

“Just making sure,” she states with false sincerity.

“Whatever,” I grumble back. “You’re going to lose the third.”

“We’ll see,” Amelia tells me, closing the distance between us.

She almost pins me twice, but I’m able to wriggle out of both, which I can tell pisses her off. Eventually, I’m able to get one of her arms pinned to the mat at an angle that doesn’t allow her to get any leverage from it, and then I wrench the other behind her back at a degree which I know hurts. She could probably get out of it, if she was willing to dislocate her shoulder to do it. I know she’s not.

“I give, you win,” she tells me, confirming it.

I release her and help her back to her feet. We head off the mat, and I sink down against the wall, breathing heavier than I should be. It’s annoying.

“Can I ask you something?” Amelia inquires quietly.

“What?”

“What happened to Lisette?”

I sigh.

“It’s just… Commander Selby asked you about her, and it seemed… well, odd. Then when you were out of it, I asked Peter. He said I should ask you, and wouldn’t tell me anything else, but I can tell when he doesn’t want to talk about something, and he didn’t want to talk about that.”

I let the silence stretch between us, trying to decide whether or not to tell her the truth, and she waits patiently.

“How close were you and Lisette?” I interrogate, finally.

“We were friendly, but we weren’t exactly friends.”

I sigh again. “I killed her,” I admit.

“Why?”

“Are you going to see Peter tonight?”

“Yes,” she answers, seeming confused by the abrupt change in topic.

“I don’t want to talk about it, but ask Peter again. Tell him I told you that I killed her and I said he can tell you about it. If he seems skeptical, tell him I said it’s not like at the churro shop,” I state as I stand and begin to leave.

“Not like at the churro shop?”

“He’ll know.”

“Where are you going?” she asks me.

“To talk to my mother,” I call over my shoulder.

“Are you sure that’s a good idea?”

“No. That’s why I’m telling you.”

----

I go out over the back wall, the same way I used to. It almost makes me feel normal. I could go through the gates, sure, but if I did someone would undoubtedly tell Liam, and I’m equally sure the information would somehow make its way back to Commander Selby, as well.

I don’t particularly feel like letting Liam know where I’m going, at the moment. I’m sure he would try to talk me out of it or want to come with me, and I don’t need the irritation of that conversation or the distraction of having him tag along into enemy territory.

It’s evening, but it’s not dark yet, though the shadows are definitely growing longer as I make my way towards the center of the city, and the house my mother has been residing in.

I stand in the shadows against a nearby building, and watch the house. I haven’t actually been here before, and I don’t particularly feel like entering through the front door. In this part of town, you can’t loiter outside a house staring through the windows without someone coming to ask questions and encourage you to be on your way, so I wrap the shadows around myself a little bit more tightly and let them whisper ‘don’t look here’ to anyone who might glance in my direction. If someone is specifically looking for me, it won’t be enough to stop them from seeing me, but it should do the trick for everyone else, and I’m not expecting anyone to be specifically looking for me.

An hour goes by while I wait for the sun to set, and then another thirty minutes as I wait for dusk to give way to night. Finally, it’s dark enough that foot traffic has slowed to the point where I feel like I can probably make it into the house unobserved.

The house is brick with recessed mortar joints, so it’s easy to climb. I opt to enter via a second floor window. Once inside, I carefully close the window behind me, and stay frozen in place listening for a few moments. But I hear nothing.

I open the doors as I come to them and look inside. Most of the rooms appear unoccupied, which makes sense, since as far as I know, there are only four people staying in this house full time, and there are bedrooms for at least double that. Eventually, I find the room I’m fairly confident my mother is staying in, and take a seat on a chair in the corner opposite the door, which has the advantages of being away from the window, in shadow, and opposite the bed, so it’s unlikely to be the first place your eyes look when you enter the room.

Then I wait.

One hour turns to two. Then three. Finally, sometime shortly before midnight, the door opens and my mother steps into the room. She shuts the door behind her and walks toward the bed.

“Hello, mother,” I say once her back is to me.

She gives the smallest of twitches before masking it, but I can tell she was startled. I smile as she turns toward me.

“I was expecting you days ago.”

I shrug. “I was busy.”

She says nothing.

“The magic binding me to Liam, can I undo it?”

“No.”

“Can you?” I ask.

“Even if I could, I wouldn’t, but no. Not as such.”

“Lovely.”

She grins, and it looks vicious. “Yes. Quite.”

“Why are you still here?” I pry. “What happened to Corriven and then Avonare?”

“All in due time. If you had simply gone to Dairuvar as requested, I would already be in Avonare but, as ever, you have to make things difficult.”

“I have a life here and no desire to go to Dairuvar.”

“That doesn’t matter.”

“No. Of course not. Why would it?”

“You only exist because of me, daughter,” she asserts.

“Whatever,” I reply, rolling my eyes. “What was Iverson looking for in the flat?”

“Which flat?” she asks.

She’s playing dumb. I’m sure of it. Like I said, it’s a viable strategy.

“The one that got your brother killed. William was it?” I inquire, flippantly. “Was he the one you failed?” I think I see her wince.

“People have been gossiping,” she states.

“People have,” I confirm. “So was it him? Because from what I heard, the whole thing was your idea, and then he died in the making of it. Which seems like it would make it pretty squarely your fault.”

I feel her magic begin to gather around her.

“Tsk tsk, mother,” I chide. “We both know that won’t end well for you.”

“I couldn’t possibly say,” she says breezily, cutting off whatever she was in the process of doing.

“Mmm. So you’re friends with Commander Selby?”

“The enemy of my enemy, as they say.”

“Seeing the future? You didn’t think that was worth mentioning at any point? Ever?” I demand.

“No. Why would I?”

“Because it seems like something I should have known,” I snap.

“Well, perhaps in the future you would be wise to be a little less sure of yourself when someone tells you something, daughter.”

“Perhaps.” I can’t exactly disagree with that statement. “Do you know what happened?”

“To you?” she asks.

“Yes.”

“Well, judging from your appearance, I’d say that, as usual, you decided you were far more capable than you are.”

“I’m alive, so I’d say my assessment of my capabilities was spot on,” I counter.

“I suspect you got lucky,” she says, watching me closely. “Ah. There it is. You agree.”

“No. I didn’t get ‘lucky.’ I made a decision based on a solid understanding of the risks, and I survived. As I anticipated.” This is all true.

“Then, why are you asking me if I know what happened?”

“Just curious, but it seems you don’t. That’s unfortunate. It was interesting. You would be interested. But alas, there doesn’t seem to be any reason for me to share that information with you.” I stand and walk to the door to let myself out.

“Goodbye, daughter,” I hear her comment from behind me.

I don’t look back as I close the door, even though the skin on the nape of my neck prickles slightly. I descend the staircase and let myself out through the front door.

The temperature has decreased at least a good fifteen degrees since I entered the house, and I find myself wishing I had brought a jacket as I descend the steps to the street. I hear an owl hoot somewhere nearby at nearly the same instant I hear a scuff behind me, followed by something smashing into my skull. Then there’s only darkness.

### 44 - Bury a Friend

It’s dark out when I wake up, and Hazel isn’t beside me. She’s not anywhere in the room, and it doesn’t look like she came back after she left last night. I try to see if I can feel where she is through our connection, and all I can tell is that she feels distant, and she doesn’t respond. I’m hoping it’s simply because she’s mad at me, but I don’t think so. I’m pretty sure even if she is still mad at me, and she probably is, she’d respond, if for no other reason than she would want me to in the same scenario. I don’t bother trying the ring. It’s unlikely I’ll get any more of a response from that.

I check Hazel’s room, on the off chance she’s there. Or was there. When I get to the door, I can tell it’s unoccupied as soon as I touch it. I remember Hazel doing the same thing to Davy’s door once and proclaiming he wasn’t home. I didn’t understand then how she knew. But now I get it. Behind the door feels empty. I let myself in anyway, and the undisturbed dust on every surface agrees she hasn’t been here at all since returning.

Damn.

I head to the main gate. Amelia should be on gate duty soon, and maybe whoever is there now will have seen Hazel coming or going.

It’s still dark outside, though I can see the faintest brightening on the eastern horizon, and the birds have already begun to sing. My boots tapping as they hit the stone are the only other sounds in the predawn air.

I tap softly on the gatehouse door before opening it.

“Good morning, Edward.”

“Captain Marten,” he blurts out, clearly surprised.

“Do you have any record of Hazel Raidane coming or going since the gates closed last night?”

“No, sir,” he tells me, glancing at the logbook. “No one has come or gone since the gates closed.”

I withhold a sigh. “Thanks. I’m going to take over the remainder of your shift. You’re free to go.”

He looks mildly perplexed, but doesn’t ask any questions as he leaves.

It’s another hour and a half before Amelia shows up, coming from the city rather than the campus just as the sun begins to creep over the horizon.

“Liam, what are you doing here?” she asks when she sees me.

“Did you see Hazel last night? She said she was going to find you.”

“Yes.”

“Okay, do you know where she is?”

“Why?”

“Amelia,” I growl, letting my frustration creep into my voice.

“I don’t know if she wants you to know where she is. She seemed pretty irritated last night. And I don’t know for sure that it was because of you, but I’m betting it was because of you.”

“Yes,” I snap. “It was because of me. Of course it was because of me. But she didn’t come back and she’s not in her room, or anywhere else on campus right now. So. Where. Was. She. Going?”

Amelia pauses for a minute, chewing on her lip, debating.

“Fine. She said she was going to talk to her mother.”

“Alexandria?”

“Unless she has another one,” Amelia says sarcastically.

Fine. I deserve that. “Why?”

“I don’t know. She didn’t say and I didn’t ask.”

“And you let her go?” I can’t believe what I’m hearing.

“Yes. I don’t know if you’ve noticed Liam, but Hazel’s a big girl. She can take care of herself. If she wants to talk to her mother, she can talk to her mother. She doesn’t need your approval or help for that.”

*What the fuck is going on here?* I wonder. “She said you two were friends. I didn’t get it, but I see it now,” I mutter. “Okay, Amelia. You’re clearly angry about something. What?”

“You didn’t tell me about Lisette.”

“Ah. And Hazel did.” I’m surprised. I want to ask her how the subject came up, but my curiosity is neither here nor there at the moment.

“Yes.”

“Telling you when we first returned didn’t seem wise, and there hasn’t exactly been a great time to bring it up since then.”

“It’s still shitty of you.”

“Yes,” I agree.

“Okay, good. Just so you know.”

I nod. “What time did she leave?”

“Around six or seven, I think.”

“And she didn’t say anything about going to see anyone else? Or staying anywhere else?”

“No.”

“Thanks.”

----

It’s late afternoon before I can get away long enough to go speak to Alexandria. Anna answers almost as soon as I knock on the door, like she was standing on the other side waiting.

“I’d like to see Alexandria,” I tell her.

She inclines her head toward the sitting room we were in last time, and starts up the staircase when she sees me headed in the direction she indicated. I take a seat on the same sofa as last time. The entire room looks the same. Even the bronze statue is still on the table in front of the sofa where Alex left it when he removed it from the bookshelf. I’m mildly surprised neither Anna nor Alexandria put it back in its place.

“Hello, Liam. Back so soon?”

“Do you know where Hazel is?” I ask, cutting to the chase.

“Not precisely.”

“Do you *imprecisely* know where she is then?”

She smiles. “I begin to see why she likes you.”

“I really wish people would stop saying that,” I mutter as much to myself as to her.

“You must admit, on the surface, you two are an odd pairing.”

“Do you know where she is?” I ask again, redirecting us back to the only thing I’m actually interested in.

“Yes, of course I know where she is. She’s my *daughter*. I *always* know where she is.”

“Where is she?”

“With her father. As she should be.”

I think my heart misses a beat. “Iverson? She’s with Iverson?”

“Yes, of course. He came to collect her last night.”

“You knew? And you let him *take* her?”

“Yes. She’s on her way to fulfill her destiny. As she should be. Now, I’m very busy. You can see yourself out,” she tells me as she stands and heads toward the door, turning her back on me in dismissal.

Without thinking, I pick up the bronze statue, and hurl it at her head with the full force of my anger behind it. It hits her skull with a disturbing thwack before falling to the ground with a hard thud as it hits the carpet. Alexandria follows quickly, sinking to her knees before falling face first onto the floor.

I feel her begin to pull power to herself in an effort to, I assume, heal the damage I’ve just done.

“No. No magic, Alexandria,” I tell her, lacing enough power into the words to ensure she stops.

I close the distance between us. It’s less than twelve feet, but it seems like it takes forever before I’m standing over her. The head wound looks nasty. I definitely see bone, and I think I see brain matter as well. I use the toe of my boot to roll her over onto her back.

She’s groaning incoherently, and struggling to keep her eyes open. The head wound is almost certainly going to be fatal without magic to fix it. But head wounds can take forever to kill a person depending on whether the brain is bleeding or swelling or both, and I don’t have all day to stand around and make sure she dies.

I draw a knife from my belt. It’s like Hazel said: You don’t leave an enemy behind at your back. I sink the knife into her chest up to its hilt before removing it and wiping it clean on her dress, which I distantly notice is the same color as the blood.

I check her pulse, and find none.

I let myself out of the house, and it seems like seconds later that I’m standing in front of the door to Davy’s flat.

I knock, and it’s only moments before I hear footsteps. Alex throws open the door, looking disappointed when he sees it’s me.

“Expecting someone else?” I ask.

“Davy’s been gone since early this morning. He left to go to the market, and hasn’t been back since.”

I sigh. “Let’s go inside.”

“You know something?” Alex asks, and I hear the worry edging into his voice.

“Inside,” I say again, more firmly.

“What do you know?” Alex questions when we’ve reached the top of the staircase.

“Sit,” I tell him, waiting until he complies. “What was with the bronze statue the other day?”

“What?”

“At your mom’s. You were messing around with stuff on the bookshelves. Then you took a bronze statue, and brought it over to the table, and set it there. Why?”

“I don’t know. Who cares?”

“Why, Alex?”

“It seemed like it belonged there.”

“Fucking hell,” I mutter. “I’ve just come from visiting your mother. She’s dead, by the way.”

He blinks slowly. “Good. You killed her?”

I nod. “With the statue you left on the table.”

I can see the realization flickering over his face. “No… that’s not—no.”

“Sorry, but it seems so.”

“Shit.” He takes a breath. “Whatever. It doesn’t matter. Where’s Davy?”

Now it’s my turn to take a breath. “Hazel’s gone too. That’s why I went to see your mother. Amelia was with Hazel last night, and said Hazel told her that’s where she was going. Then Hazel didn’t come back. Your mother said Iverson took her. Alexandria knew and she let it happen.”

“Fuck. So he has both of them.”

“Probably,” I agree.

“Davy’s been gone since early this morning. Almost twelve hours. If they’re pushing the horses, and they don’t care about running them into the ground—which is a safe bet—they could be nearly five hundred miles away by now, and if they change out the horses and don’t stop, they’ll make it to Dairuvar long before we have a chance to catch up.”

I nod, having reached the same conclusion.

Alex closes his eyes, and I swear it’s like I can feel him running through scenarios in his mind, trying to play them out to the end. Testing each to see which is most viable.

Finally, he says, “They’re going to have to get themselves out. We can’t do it, Liam. If we go to Dairuvar, we’re just going to be giving Iverson two more hostages.”

“I know,” I say softly.

Alex’s fingers blanch white on the table. I think maybe he was hoping I would disagree. That I would give him an excuse. But I can’t. He’s right.

*Tap. Tap.*

“Did you hear that?” I ask.

“What?”

*Tap. Tap.*

“That! It sounds like it’s coming from the balcony,” I say as I head toward the doors.

When I open them I see… an owl? I look toward the sky, just to make sure, and the sun is definitely still up.

“Alex, there’s an owl on the balcony.”

“An owl? Hazel?” he asks as he jumps up.

The owl meets my eyes, and then looks down in a manner that seems deliberate. I follow its eyes to my feet, where I see a crumpled piece of paper. I pick it up and carefully begin to open it and smooth it out.

*I has H & D. Following on GWW. Send G & P. Feed owl. —Gg*

“No. Giorgi. He confirms Iverson has Hazel and Davy and says he’s following them on the Great Western Way. He wants me to send Gavin and Peter after him. And we’re supposed to feed the owl.”

“Always knew I liked him,” Alex says, grinning. “Good. Now when Hazel and Davy get themselves out, they’ll have backup.”

“What the hell do we feed an owl?”

### 45 - All Apologies

I wake up to the afternoon light slanting sideways and stabbing right into my eyes. The world is swaying and bouncing, and it feels hard to form a coherent thought over the pounding of my head and nausea that’s got me locked in his grip.

“Careful moving. I think you have a concussion.”

“Davy?” I manage to get out, but even to me it sounds garbled, like I’m speaking around a mouthful of marbles.

“Yeah.”

“Where are we?

“In the back of a cart.”

“Why?”

He sighs. “I think we’re on our way to Dairuvar.”

“Fuck,” I mutter. “I went to see my mother and then…”

“You were already in the wagon unconscious when I woke up. I was headed to the market. There was a smoke cloud and then nothing.”

“How long has it been?” I try to move but I can’t. I’m well and firmly trussed.

“Half a day.”

“No magic?”

“No magic,” he confirms.

I’m in no position to try to find out about my own state right now with the way my head is throbbing. I try to open my eyes, but the light is too bright, and at exactly the wrong angle.

*Shit,* I think as I remember getting into a fight with Liam, and storming off angry. Liam has no idea where I am. And if we both end up dead because I got mad that Liam told Commander Selby what he already knew, I am going to be so pissed at myself.

“What about Alex?” I ask Davy.

“Not here, which is probably good news.”

“Yeah,” I agree.

“We’re going to have to get ourselves out of this.”

“Tell me something I don’t already know, oh wise one,” I gripe sarcastically.

“Owls sleep during the day.”

“*Owls sleep during th—*” Ah. “Yes. They do.”
