# Book 2

## Part 1

### 1 - Blue Monday

It’s two days after the dinner party where I didn’t kill my mother. Two miserable days. Everyone else is falling in line. My mother says, *‘Jump!’*and they’re quick to ask *‘How high?’*

It’s a new order.

Then there’s me. I feel like I’m being suffocated. Like I can’t breathe. I look around, and it seems like everyone else is fine. Even Alex seems *fine*. And I can’t understand it. How are they okay with this? How are they okay with letting Liam’s life be used as collateral for her own? With allowing her to force us all to take her back to Branton? With her decision to become involved in the Allied Polities politics? As if there’s any surer way to start a war than to let her rule Avonare.

I’ve been spending a lot of time alone on the roof, thinking. Weighing my options. Considering things. Endeavoring to act instead of react, because Peter was right about that.

Liam has tried more than once to convince me to come inside. Alex and Davy have both been up here to do the same. Gavin was up here a few hours ago.

Giorgi is here now.

Unlike the others, he’s been quiet. Hasn’t so much as said hello. Just nodded and sat down a few feet away about an hour ago.

The way I see it, she can kill Liam exactly once, and the second she does, she’s dead, and she knows it. Which means she can’t kill him at all. She thinks he’s leverage, and he is. Kind of. But he’s piss poor leverage. She’s not nearly so clever as she thinks she is.

I sigh. “What’s your take on all this?” I ask Giorgi, finally breaking my silence.

He leans back on his palms and shakes his blond hair out of his face. I can see him considering his words for a long moment before he finally says, “I don’t think she can see the future.”

“Fucking thank you!” I burst out with more than a hint of relief. I’m so glad to hear someone else say the same thing. “Why?” I ask him. I know all the reasons I don’t believe her, but I want to hear his.

He shrugs. “She’s too nervous. All the time.”

“What do you mean?”

“She’s nervous in the same way that you’re restless,” he elaborates after several moments. “It’s practically a character trait.”

“Huh. I never noticed.”

“Her left hand,” he states. “She has a habit of running her thumb across the pad of her middle finger. It’s small and you have to be looking for it, but it’s there.”

“You’re sure it’s nervousness?”

“Pretty sure.”

“Thanks. That helps.”

He nods.

It’s late afternoon when I go back inside. I need to talk to Liam before I talk to anyone else, and he’ll be thrilled I’m not on the roof. I check the room we’ve been sharing—the room I refuse to refer to as mine—first, but he’s not there. I check the room Davy and Alex have been occupying next, but it’s empty as well.

I finally give in and do what I should have done days ago and feed magic back into the tracking spell I had abandoned. It falls back into place with an ease that makes me question whether or not I really want to do this. In for a penny, though.

I feel everyone outside somewhere, off to the southwest and I go looking. I’m not about to stay in this house alone for a second.

I find them all about a mile away down a small trail that threads through the woods. I don’t remember this being here last time I was in Leisch. But that was years ago.

Unfortunately, when I walk into the clearing I realize they really are *all* in the woods. My mother included.

“Good. You’ve decided to join us, daughter,” she remarks haughtily.

I manage to refrain from correcting her as I take a up a position between Liam and Alex.

“I think Hazel has mentioned she prefers to be called by her name, Alexandria,” Peter tells her.

I find myself an odd mixture of surprised, confused, and grateful—surprised that anyone else bothered to say something, confused that it was Peter, and grateful that it was someone other than me since she clearly doesn’t listen to or care what I have to say.

She says nothing, and only levels a cold, appraising look at him instead.

I watch her left hand, and notice Giorgi is right. She is ever so slightly rubbing the nail of her thumb across the tip of her middle finger. Interesting.

She continues staring Peter down, but he doesn’t look away. He just mildly matches her stare, but manages to do so without a hint of malice showing in his blue eyes.

“Hmm,” she finally says, before looking away first.

*What the hell just happened?* I wonder.

“Children,” she begins, and I hear Gavin smothering a laugh, which quickly spreads and suddenly, as we all stand there laughing, I feel better than I have in days. Weeks even. Probably since before we left Branton.

I hear the crack echo through the clearing, and my mirth quickly vanishes. I look over to note a red handprint darkening Gavin’s left cheek, and before I can think better of it, I’m moving toward her. I grab her right shoulder and spin her toward me at the same time I shove, off balancing her enough so that she takes a step back, and trips over the foot I’ve planted in her path, sending her sprawling onto her back. I follow her down onto the ground, driving a knee into her stomach, and placing my forearm across her neck. I note that her eyes have widened in shock or fear. I’m not sure which.

“You do not get to hurt my friends,” I tell her flatly, before slowly withdrawing my arm. “If you want to teach them, and they agree, fine.”

“I’ll do what I like, daughter. Or did you forget about Liam?”

“No, I did not forget about Liam. And No, you will *not* do what you like. You can kill Liam exactly once. And then you know what will happen. So you *will* stop with the idle threats toward Liam, and you will not hurt my friends. If you want allies,” I continue, “then you will treat us like allies. Do you understand?”

She says nothing, which I take as assent, and I return to my spot between Liam and Alex.

Alex throws an arm around my shoulders, which helps some to mitigate the adrenaline coursing through my body, but I still feel shaky. This is not exactly how I planned on this going, and I’m not sure what the fallout is going to be.

I cast a sideways glance at Liam, hoping he’s not too upset by the fact that I just told my mother to try me when his life is at stake. This is why I was hoping to talk to him alone first. I knew we would get to this point, and I knew it wouldn’t take long. I was just hoping it would take a little bit longer than this. But I’m done letting her be… her. It’s like I said, if she wants allies then we deserve to be treated as such.

It *is* a new fucking order. For everyone.

Thankfully, Liam looks unperturbed and reaches out to take my hand when he notices me glancing at him, which makes me feel a lot more secure in my decision not to let my mother run roughshod over us all.

My mother regains her feet, and continues on as if nothing happened. “Today you will all be learning magic.”

I sigh. I’d feel a lot better if I had any idea what she was planning, but I guess there’s no time like the present to find out.

(( you should figure this out ))

----

My mother concludes her… class after a couple of hours and I think it left everyone frustrated. She spent a solid twenty minutes babbling on about esoteric energy meridians, then had them spend another twenty minutes visualizing the energy flowing along their meridians, ‘*up and down, and up and down.’* I’m not kidding. She must have said ‘up and down’ at least two hundred times. Then she had them spend an hour and a half trying to push some rocks across the ground by projecting their energy meridians outward. It’s like she was trying to make everything as confusing as possible.

“Did any of that make sense to anyone?” Henry finally asks after my mother has left.

“No,” Giorgi answers and everyone else nods in agreement with him.

“Wanting something and letting yourself have it makes a lot more sense,” Gavin says.

Henry nods in agreement with Gavin, but Lisette says, “None of it makes any sense!”

Of everyone, she’s the most frustrated. She was the one who asked if I could teach her and she still hasn’t figured out how to untie the knot, but Gavin and Henry both have. I’m not sure if Giorgi’s even bothered trying.

“Fine,” I sigh. “Lisette. Come sit,” I tell her as I take a seat cross legged on the ground. “Liam, can you watch too?” I ask him.

He nods and takes a seat next to me as Lisette takes a seat across from me.

“Okay. Show me,” I tell her.

“Show you what? I can’t *do* anything!”

“Try to untie the knot. Even if nothing happens.”

I see a look of intense focus on her face, and I feel something, but it doesn’t exactly feel like she’s close. I look at Liam. “What do you think?”

“I don’t know,” he tells me. “I’ve only really paid attention to you, Alex, and Davy doing magic and I doubt that’s a valid comparison.”

“Gavin, can you untie the knot, please?” I ask.

He nods, and then does it with surprising quickness. Just a couple of seconds.

Once he’s done, I ask the same of Henry. Henry’s not as fast as Gavin, but he’s under the ten seconds I mentioned that first day.

“Try again, Lisette,” I say.

She wears the same look of frustration as she does tries to unknot the fabric strip.

“So,” I say to Liam again, “what do you think?”

“I feel something, but it’s not like what it felt like when Henry and Gavin did it.”

I nod. “It felt the same to me.” I’m not really sure how to help. “Davy, any ideas?” I ask.

He shrugs. “She wanted to learn to make a fire. Try that.”

I sigh. “Fine. Tomorrow we’ll try fire,” I tell them all. “Until then, Lisette, keep trying the knot, and I don’t know. I guess the shit with the energy meridians or whatever. It sounds ridiculous to me, but who knows.

“Giorgi, are you getting in on this?” I ask.

He shrugs, but says, “Sure.”

“Can you do the knot?”

“I haven’t tried. I don’t care about unknotting some fabric, Hazel.”

I let out a long suffering sigh, but say, “Fine. Can you keep an eye on my mother? Earlier may have been a mistake.”

He nods and walks away back toward the house. Lisette, Gavin, and Henry trail after him.

“Hey, Peter,” I call out as he moves to leave too. “Thanks for earlier.”
